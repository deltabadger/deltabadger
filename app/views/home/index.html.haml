          %i Dollar-cost averaging
        (DCA) is a well known strategy of passive investing. When you buy Bitcoin for the same amount of money at fixed intervals, you buy more when the price is lower, and less when the price is higer. You get a fair average price avoiding stress of jumping in at the wrong moment. Now, you can automate the process. Set, start and forget. The bot will be buying pieces as small as $5 according to your desired schedule, at the exchange of your choice.
