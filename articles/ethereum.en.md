A month after social streams celebrated Ethereum's 10th birthday, it approaches a long-awaited all-time high, but it's not social media hype that drives it. By legitimizing stablecoins, the GENIUS Act put it back in the spotlight as the main blockchain processing 'digital dollar' transfers. At the same time, the SEC gave the green light for the GDLC ETF, making both individual and institutional investors pay attention. All of this, while Ethereum treasury companies became a hot topic. It's a good moment to look closer at the state of the second-biggest cryptocurrency.

## The Infrastructure for Decentralized Finance

As we noticed discussing the GENIUS Act, crypto has a huge growing use case, and it's stablecoins. Stablecoins have grown from $6 billion to $270 billion in just 6 years—a 45x increase—while the entire ecosystem now moves $27.6 trillion annually, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. 

This isn't speculative trading volume but real economic activity, with emerging markets driving adoption often being effectively dollarized. On top of that, the US government decided to actively use web3 infrastructure in their politics rather than suppress it.

## Layer 2

*Layer 2* solutions are secondary blockchains built on top of Ethereum's main network that process transactions faster and cheaper while inheriting the security of the underlying Layer 1. These L2s have transformed Ethereum from a congested network struggling with 15 transactions per second into a scalable ecosystem now processing over 250 TPS collectively, with a clear path to 5,000+ TPS as blob space increases.

This expanded throughput has enabled entirely new categories of applications that were previously impossible due to high fees and slow settlement times. Prediction markets like Polymarket being the best example. For a long-time staying theoretical, they finally materialized.

## TradFi Pays Attention

The SEC's approval of the GDLC ETF, opens door for a regulated exposure to diversified cryptocurrency portfolios that include significant Ethereum allocations. 

Following the hype around Bitcoin treasury companies, with Tom Lee's Ethereum Treasury BitMine (BMNR) accumulating over 1.15 million ETH while publicly targeting 5% of total ETH supply. Unlike Bitcoin treasury companies that rely purely on price appreciation, Ethereum-focused vehicles offer a theoretical advantage through staking yields, potentially providing steady revenue streams for shareholders.
