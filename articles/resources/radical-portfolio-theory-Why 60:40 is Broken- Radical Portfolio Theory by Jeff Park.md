# Radical Portfolio Theory: Why 60/40 is Broken - Interview with Jeff Park

**Host:** Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of 21st Capital. Today is January 21st—it's a very cold day, I think at both places—and we have the privilege of talking with Jeff Park from Bitwise, Head of Alpha Strategies. He's a very brilliant analyst and commentator of the Bitcoin space. I love to follow his account, full of alpha as his title suggests. Welcome, Jeff!

**Jeff:** Thank you, Cena. Happy to be here. It is very cold today here in New York, and it sounds like by your introduction it is cold in the South as well.

## From Stanford to Wall Street: Jeff Park's Academic Journey

**Host:** One of the reasons I was super excited to talk to you was my coverage of ETF activities earlier last year. It feels like ages ago, but we were actually talking with the community at the level where people were thinking ETFs are just a bunch of paper Bitcoin designed to short Bitcoin. We were trying to put out content explaining how massive this thing is going to be.

Thank you guys for being there and adding fuel to the fire, especially the Bitwise team. They're amazing in terms of their outreach—I see all the events they go to, all the groundwork they do to educate Wall Street and investors about Bitcoin. Your work took us to the next level in Bitcoin.

Other than that, you have this fantastic thesis about portfolio construction—Radical Portfolio Theory. That will be the focus today. We'd like to learn all about it, how it emerged, and especially why you think we should completely rethink the investment approach and portfolio construction approach.

Let's begin with a little bit of your introduction. Tell us some background—where you did your studies and how you wound up at Bitwise.

**Jeff:** Happy to kick it off. I actually studied biology in my undergraduate years. At the very beginning, I was pre-med, like you might expect any good Asian kid might be. I was really interested in the academic side of research functions and also really loved economics because I like math—but applied math more than just theoretical.

I was doing a double major and then stumbled on Wall Street. I tried healthcare investment banking as a summer analyst, which was kind of interesting but not exactly the thing that gravitated my mind toward what I found most interesting—the trading floor.

I started my career at Morgan Stanley as an exotic equity derivatives trader. I completely gave up on the pre-med side of things, but I really liked the capital markets. For me, the capital markets as they exist today—as they were back then—is maybe one of the most fascinating innovations of our times, where the greatest minds come to compete. At the end of the day, you get a scorecard. You know exactly how you competed. It's very fair, it's very meritocratic, and there's something about this that's very exciting.

## Bitcoin's First Impression: How Jeff Discovered Digital Gold

For me, being a quantitatively minded person, when I first discovered Bitcoin on the trading desk 10-plus years ago, it felt like this was very important. Bitcoin would represent not just interesting quantitative qualities about the volatility profile, but as somebody who lived through the financial crisis at the beginning of my career in 2008, it's very easy for me to be cynical about the system that we've inherited and the ways it can be challenged by something as novel and radical as Bitcoin.

All of those things registered as a lightbulb for me, and I've been following the industry ever since. I joined Bitwise about three years ago after a long career in the hedge fund industry, focusing on multi-strategy equities and credit solutions.

I think Bitcoin, as well as crypto, really represents a lot of learnings that come from looking at alternative assets that can be applied in a whole new way. That's what I'm really interested in, and that's what I do at Bitwise. I'm the head of alpha strategies—we have multi-strategy alpha-centric solutions for our institutional investors, but we also have ETFs that are tracking active trading strategies.

I think these will be the next hyper-financialization of Bitcoin into something a little bit more useful, risk-adjusted, and maybe interesting for certain select types of investors looking for something different than just passively tracking the spot exposure.

2025, I believe, is the year that we're going to see a lot of issuers come to market, bringing what they think is actually the most valuable feature about Bitcoin and being able to capitalize upon it as a useful financial product.

**Host:** You just reminded me of Michael Saylor's refinery analogy. So 2025 is the year refineries will begin creating multiple layers of risk—bond-like versus leverage fund-like performance. Looking forward to that. I know you're also working on some of those products. Maybe we'll talk about them if time permits.

## Revolutionary Investing: Jeff's Radical Portfolio Theory Explained

**Host:** Let's begin with your work on Radical Portfolio Theory. I want to ask: where does that 60/40 come from? I've always managed my own money essentially because I'm like, "What can an advisor do for me? I'm not going to argue with them about my Bitcoin, so what's the point?"

Most of the time, 100% of my investable money has been in Bitcoin, so there's been no point in any kind of financial advisor. I haven't been in those circles where they would put me on 60/40 or something like that. But where does that come from? Is it some kind of analysis somebody did 40 years ago? I have a hard time understanding how a fixed portfolio construction can survive so many decades.

**Jeff:** 60/40 is a great marketing gimmick. It's essentially capturing a few salient points that people remember by just hearing about those particular words. First, it's very simple—there are only two things you have to think about: equities and bonds. That's very easy for people to wrap their head around.

Second, they're saying one thing should be slightly larger than the other by having a 10% difference across the two pies and expressing a view that you should position yourself for growth—which is the 60% in equities. It's a neat trick, and I think it actually made a lot of sense for folks thinking about increasing their wealth generation by investing in thoughtful portfolio construction.

But the reality is 60/40 is actually very old and dated. The reason it's irrelevant today is that most institutional investors have already moved away from that construct, thinking about alternative assets and private investments that can encapsulate uncorrelated returns even from the public market.

I had a brief stint at the Harvard endowment before my hedge fund career, and already within the Harvard endowment model, you have these endowment allocation public policy portfolio concepts where equities and bonds in the public format are actually fairly constrained relative to what they're doing in the private space—like infrastructure, real estate, private equity, venture capital, and alternative assets like litigation financing or insurance investing.

There's actually a whole section that endowments and pensions are already thinking about diversifying beyond the 60/40.

## Can Banks Embrace Bitcoin? A Peek into the Future of Finance

**Host:** You mentioned a predisposition to being cynical about the system. When I first learned about Bitcoin, I was going through a similar thought process. A lot of traditional finance is heavily guarded and gatekept by traditional institutions, and they're benefiting from this massively.

There are mandates to do whatever you need to do in the finance realm through financial institutions. In other words, they're protected, and their customer base is guaranteed. Someone said being in finance is like being at the tight part of an hourglass where there's a lot of money going through, and you just pick a little bit of it every time.

This whole alternative assets thing—even Trump's memecoin, which sounded outrageous to me—has another side that shows we are disintermediating these institutions. There's no barrier anymore. Anyone can go online, and if they have an audience, they can make themselves tradable 24/7 across the world.

I don't know how banks will deal with this. They probably thought about stopping it in the past few years, but that's not possible. One of my key concerns when learning about Bitcoin was: "Is this thing killable?" After months of studying, I realized it's a resounding no. That's where I actually went all-in on Bitcoin.

Without that option, these traditional institutions will probably have to join and benefit from continuing to charge fees on transactions. They can add a lot of value, especially because they're regulated—they can add easy insurance, financial products, integration with everyone else's financial activities.

But I suspect there's still regulation preventing it, right? SAB 121 and probably a lot more that I don't know about are preventing banks from offering services. Do you think this year we can get some reprieve and enable banks to custody Bitcoin or provide easy trading? It would be a game-changer if you could buy Bitcoin directly in your Fidelity account, withdraw it, deposit Bitcoin, get loans on your Bitcoin stack, and so on.

**Jeff:** There's a lot about the banking system that we take for granted that we're taught in school—about how the economy works and how banking services are provided. If you grow up not thinking about the entrenchment of that system, it's easy to not think about it because of the ease with which we can process payments. Everything seems to work well and feels expedient with electronic execution.

But that's all surface-level. The backend is actually still very obsolete. The thing that crypto is doing is really turning upside down some of the most fundamental assumptions we've taken for granted in the system.

When I was a kid, I remember learning about a stock for the first time and asking my dad about it. I asked him, "What is a stock?" He said it's basically your right to owning a piece of a company and its associated income as a shareholder in profit participation. I said, "That's really cool! So if I have a Microsoft stock, does Bill Gates know who I am?" My dad was like, "Well, no." I was like, "Why not?" He said, "Because you're technically not on their books and records." So I was like, "Oh, so I don't own it?" He said, "No, but you do own it."

When you go down this path, even as a fifth grader, you realize there are a lot of asterisks to things you're being told about what a financial asset is and isn't. The thing about Bitcoin that's really amazing is that it's attacking at the core this issue of custody.

In the Microsoft example, you have an intermediary as a custodian who actually is the holder on the books and records. There are benefits that come from this—it makes settlement easier, clearing easier, fraud probably less prevalent in ways that protect consumers. But in the end, you actually don't own it.

Bitcoin is the thing that really turns the custody model upside down. There are risks that come with this too—risks that I don't know if everyone in the world is ready for. But at the same time, it's a new way to think about a financial primitive. That's the exciting thing about crypto and why regulators are concerned.

It's really attacking the core social contract of the banking model, which is custody. That has implications for lending and derivatives that exist on top of the ownership of those assets.

## Bitcoin ETFs vs. Bank Services: Will They Clash?

Let me tell you something about Bitcoin ETFs in ways that have been a great product-market fit for various investors. There are a lot of people who still want to own Bitcoin but don't want to have the worry and insurance of thinking about custody. This is very much a human thing—humans have lots of other things they need to focus on. They don't want to deal with self-custody if they feel this is not value-add to them.

The Bitcoin ETF actually helps bridge this gap. The beautiful thing is because it fits into the regulated system, you can actually now lend Bitcoin through the stock lending program as it exists in the regulated markets without counterparty risk.

There are positive expected value features about the Bitcoin ETF that Bitcoin actually still may not be able to compete with—the amount of liquidity that the ETFs can draw because of the social contract that exists in that model creates all kinds of possibilities.

There are a lot of people who still want to own Bitcoin in their regulated accounts—they want it in their tax-advantaged IRAs, their Roth IRAs. They want it to play nicely with their financial advisors and be represented in a broker statement that looks like other multi-asset portfolios. There are benefits to having crypto plug into the traditional system that brings new adoption and utilities.

**Host:** Do you think if banks provide custody services, would that hurt the ETF model? There seems to be infinite demand for the ETFs, but how do you think about new competition coming online?

**Jeff:** No, it's great for ETF issuers because we leverage the relationships and services provided by custodians. Nothing would be better than having competition at that level—whether because they're bringing better technology, better pricing, or better client servicing. You need competition.

We want more custodians to come into the space like Bank of New York Mellon, State Street—folks who have market share and understanding of how the system works from a different lens than just being crypto-native only. It's not that crypto-native isn't valuable, but there's a whole system that comes with those players.

That's actually the low-hanging fruit of 2025. People talk about excitement about what Trump is going to do to push crypto as a top national priority agenda, but I think Trump really doesn't have to do very much—he just needs to get out of the way and not block paths to innovation.

SAB 121 is something that's so easy and bipartisan to think about removing. It's not even pro-crypto; it's just pro-good administrative policies and rulemaking. The private fund advisory rules are similar—the necessity of having a qualified custodian to offer services as an SEC-registered RIA is virtuous, but it creates friction points for investors outside of even crypto.

Most private assets are not administered with a custodian model to begin with. If you invest in a venture company, there's no custodian that intermediates the representation of those assets. They're exempt because they're offered under different securities offerings, but there are ways to bridge the gap that aren't so onerous to the progress of alternative assets as a whole, including crypto.

## Why 60/40 Portfolios Are Failing: A Deep Dive into the Flaws

**Host:** Let's go back to our discussion of the traditional model having flaws, including the dated 60/40, which is a nice way to destroy wealth. What are your thoughts on what should come about to replace it? How can we better construct our portfolios?

**Jeff:** First, you have to understand what's wrong with 60/40, because without understanding it, you can't possibly conceptualize the future and ways to protect yourself.

At the core of the 60/40, the number one problem is that bonds and equities, which were meant to be diversifying assets to each other, are no longer performing in that manner. Over the last three years, the monthly correlation between US equities and bonds is now at an all-time high, at a level that would throw anyone who thought about 60/40 as a diversification strategy upside down.

You might say this is just a moment in time and they'll be negatively correlated again. That's possible, but there are more signs showing that won't be the case. The reason is easy to understand.

At some point, equities used to represent growth in a way that meant productivity gains, technological advancement, and real ungraspable gains of advancement that are productive over time. I'd say that's changed. There are elements of equities that show this, but there are also a lot of elements that are being benchmarked against inflation—it's basically a way to think about being on track with the monetary debasement happening in the system.

A lot of it is because the growth model changed. Once upon a time, there really was a drive for productivity—whether profit maximization or revenue growth. Nowadays, what you see with publicly listed companies is financial manipulation that shows growth in specific ways that investors care about. Things like share buybacks are a kind of growth that isn't super productive. Yes, it increases the ROE, but it's not really creating productivity growth of a country or labor or capital—it's more like market manipulation.

You see this in the way the GDP model itself is flawed. There's consumption, which is private consumption driving growth, but there's also the giant "G"—government expenditure that drives growth. That's actually the biggest component these days in terms of how outsized it is that drives a country's growth trajectory.

You see it in the reflection of our debt-to-GDP ratio that's insatiably growing—this idea of fiscal-led growth by government spending. That means ultimately equities and bonds are converging because they represent similar discount models to thinking about the default risk of a country, the interest rate, and the duration risk you're willing to tolerate.

That fiscal dominance is actually the core thing that's merging equities and bonds.

## The Global Carry Trade: Is the Whole World Overleveraged?

**Host:** That's what I was trying to understand—the root cause. What I've had in mind is that because of so much government spending and money supply expansion, it's killed that balancing act that equities and bonds have been playing.

In times of growth, equities will grow, and when overextended, you rebalance and put money back in bonds. In times of economic slowdown, bonds become more attractive, so capital flows there, and your rebalancing proves successful. You grow wealth in the bond sector, and the economy goes back and forth between these two states.

But when there's so much cash flowing around and everything is getting pumped, these two just become derivatives of money supply expansion. If that's the case, what if you try to own other assets that do a better job protecting against money supply expansion?

**Jeff:** That's right. The reality is the whole world now is on some kind of giant global carry trade, and it's all based on US rates and dollar strength. It impacts everybody—China, Japan, and Europe. It's never been more interconnected as a world than it is now.

It's all kinds of games happening at the macro level between these cross-border flows and how they're exerting influences on the competing priorities of foreign policy and domestic policy as it relates to their economic power.

The US is in the most difficult position because of the fact that the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. They don't have the freedom to pursue domestic policy-maximizing strategy because it interferes with their foreign policy maximization strategies as well.

These things are becoming more obviously known in the way that everything has become hyper-financialized. When Japan raised rates by 15 basis points last summer, and the world just could not handle the possibility of something like that because Japan is the ultimate funder of everything happening in the growth model for the US—it shows you that these are all related.

60/40 might sound like two different things, but they're becoming the same thing. The goal for you and me and a whole new class of young investors is to find the thing that is not part of that at all—get out of that global carry system, period, because that's where the uncorrelated returns are going to be.

The things that are not affected by these cross-capital flows that are driven by sovereign behavior now more so than private sector-led behavior—that's the interesting part. That's why I always speak about 60% compliance assets and 40% resistance assets.

Everything in the compliance assets is what we know: public equities, bonds, even venture capital. I would put all of those in compliance assets—they play nicely within financial models that we can model and know.

***The 40% is actually about esoteric alternative assets that haven't been institutionalized yet to be participating in that giant global carry trade. Bitcoin is one of them,*** but there are also a lot of other things that crypto as an ethos brings upon that display the power of those strengths.

## Polymarket: Is Gambling a Basic Freedom?

Another example I often cite is advancements like Polymarket. If you think about what Polymarket is—essentially a decentralized market to show you different kinds of odds that people want to bet on—it's a testament to the fact that gambling at some level is, in many ways, a productive endeavor for those who have the information and capabilities.

The thing about memecoin trading and Bitcoin—even though they feel sometimes adversarial (you'll find bitcoiners saying, "Oh, memecoin trading and shitcoins are bad for Bitcoin's energy," and vice versa)—there's actually more alignment than people think. They believe in the same underlying philosophy: that individual freedom should triumph, and everyone should do what they want to do.

In a way, gambling is a fundamental human right because what I want to do with my assets and how I engage someone else to do it with is a private right. You'll see the full spectrum of gambling—those who believe everything is good about it and those who believe everything's bad about it, that we must ban Las Vegas, ban gambling period.

The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, and memecoin trading is almost an expression of a new class of investors coming out trying to emphasize the profit opportunity that could be possible for those able to navigate this new meta.

## Trump Coin and Meme Coins: Trading Strategies

**Host:** I put out a tweet—I was surprised after this Trump coin and Melania coin stuff. I've been thinking about what's happening for a few days, and I reached the conclusion that this is not going to stop anytime soon. This has shown the world that everyone can come up with a memecoin.

Previously, Ethereum and other chains were trying to say they were inventing sophisticated technology, something better than Bitcoin, which they've been promising for many years. The focus was on technological advancement and innovation.

But a memecoin is absolutely honest—it markets itself as nothing other than a name and a community. It strips away all that complexity and shows us there's demand for good old gambling. This kind of gambling has a different taste—you're gambling on someone you like, so if you're a Trump fan, you probably like his coin a lot more.

It showed me there's a new business model in town. Anyone who reaches fame previously had to go through many other channels to monetize that fame—get advertisements, partner with brand companies. But now everyone can spin up their own coin and multiply their net worth over hours.

Of course, this is going to be very volatile, and many of these coins will end up going to zero or trading at some flatline level as soon as that person's attraction goes down in the public sphere. Nevertheless, I like the idea that you can disintermediate the whole system with 24 hours of coding.

You can get yourself to corners of a small village back in Malaysia, and people there could begin funding you. There might be good things that come out of it in terms of having access to financial resources if people are interested in a cause, being able to open it up for the whole world to fund.

**Jeff:** There are a few things people misunderstand about memecoin trading. First, they think it's pure gambling like playing slot machines—truly the kinds of gambling that's mindless, where it's an addiction and negative expected value, and you really shouldn't do it. There's a spectrum of games casinos offer, and slot machines are probably one of the worst kinds of gambling because you can't apply skill.

On the other hand, you have games like poker, which is entirely about skill. It's fun, and there's something that emerges out of the social capital of certain players. Maybe they even find happiness with their friends playing games, and there's something useful about that.

Meme coin trading is actually both—it's very social, so people get utility out of this, and there's a price for that. It's almost like a consumption good—you pay money to have fun memecoin trading, just like you pay money to have fun.

Second is this idea that it's gambling without any notion of skills, and you could be so far from the truth with that statement. Meme coin trading is actually one of the most skilled things that exist at every level possible.

If you're a very good memecoin trader, you're probably a very good programmer with great technical capabilities because you need to know how to navigate blockchain latency. You need to set up bots that can trade effectively, monitor multiple pools, find liquidity in a multi-pooled way that's developing in front of you that no one's going to give you guidelines for.

These are technically super capable people—they're engineers. Of course, they're going to outcompete somebody who's sitting at their couch buying a coin because they like Donald Trump. There are levels to people's expertise, just like expertise and levels in any financial capital markets.

The third thing people bring up is information asymmetry—some people are being taken advantage of, and there are so many insiders dumping on these things, creating weird incentives. That may be true, but the reality is, if you take a step back and squint your eyes, that already exists at some level across many assets we trade in the regulated world.

If you think about SPACs and how obscure the SPAC market is, the economics that come out of the original promoters of the SPAC vehicle, and how they don't even disclose it—this is an SEC-approved listing. Those things already show you that information asymmetry is, in some way, a way of life.

The beautiful thing is with memecoins, you can see it. You can literally go check the wallets and see, "Wow, this looks horribly set up—these insiders are sketchy as hell." You can't even do that with SPACs. You can't do that with closed-end fund equity issuances. You have no idea what's happening behind the scenes about the monetization of that exact information asymmetry, and yet we permit billions of dollars to trade in regulated markets with this.

I look back at all those people and tell them ***you can't be so harsh on memecoin trading without first realizing how bad it is out there in the regulated market for information asymmetry***.

Securities law insists on inside information and material nonpublic information, but let's step out of securities—what about the commodity market, the FX market? Those aren't securities, but there's inside information in all these markets too. There are ways that the oil market moves based on things you might know about certain happenings, and that could be an edge.

In some cases, it's actually regulated and protected—those rents they can achieve. A simple example most people have experienced is the housing market. When COVID caused mayhem and the Fed panicked, killing interest rates and drawing them down to zero, many institutions were able to get super-low rates—2% or even less.

In our area, there's this company Invitation Homes that was buying whole blocks of neighborhoods when regular people couldn't access that kind of rate. It was free money. Right now, with interest rates at 8-9%, any institution that got access to that capital and was buying houses with cash is doing fantastic because they don't even have to rent those houses. They can sit on it, and rent is just a plus.

There's no way their house is going to return less than 1.5% over time because that's even less than money supply expansion. Wherever you look, there's systematic unfair advantage that different folks have.

## Choosing the Right Alternative Assets: Jeff's Investment Tips

**Host:** You focus on a wide range of alternative assets. Tell us more about what they are, and maybe give us some insight into how to think about comparing them. It's a broad statement to say you want to own 40% alternative assets, but how can people decide among all the alternatives?

**Jeff:** There are three parameters I'll put around how to think about the taxonomy of these resistance assets.

First is how you think about **scarcity value**. Ultimately, things that are scarce are valuable if other people think they're valuable. Most of the things we know in the traditional compliance world—the 60% world—are things that are not truly scarce.

Bonds are not scarce, and equities are becoming less scarce because we're seeing different ways that equity as the base layer is becoming financialized. Take Nvidia, for example—it's useful and represents something, but then there are 2x leveraged Nvidia ETFs. What are they doing? They're doubling down on the volatility profile of a stock and financializing it.

If you thought volatility itself was the thing people liked in stocks like Nvidia, well, now it's not super scarce because someone doubled it by creating this 2x leveraged ETF. Features about the things you look for can also be made abundant.

You might think about venture capital in this bucket—AI is thematically interesting, so you invest in it, thinking your company is scarce. But new companies will emerge and compete for talent. You saw it with the rideshare wars—Lyft versus Uber versus others. They're not that scarce at the end of the day. The winners may be, but along the path, there can be abundance.

The radical resistance portfolio emphasis is that you should try to find things that are truly scarce in their fundamental nature. That can come from the organic world or from labor capital. There are certain types of investments you can make that are scarce because they're bound by nature—like farmland or Bitcoin.

It could also be very rare works of art—masterworks that don't exist in abundance and maybe can't exist anymore because the artist is dead. That's truly scarce.

You can think about financial assets that can't be copy-pasted, not like the 2x leveraged ETF where you might launch a 3x leveraged ETF. I'm talking about true financial IP that takes labor capital from human ingenuity.

**Litigation financing** is an example I often point toward—it's a kind of private credit because you're funding a litigation, but you can't copy-paste it because there's only one lawsuit. Maybe there are other kinds of lawsuits, but you have to find that opportunity.

Each lawsuit and litigation looks different, and you can't trade it as a basket because the outcome isn't correlated to anything else but the trial merits themselves. One legal case won't look like the next, and they'll all have independent outcomes based on the merits of the actual lawsuit.

You can financialize this and create pools of capital, but that's still more scarce than buying high-yield bond issuances that come every 3-7 years off the shelf.

The second thing beyond scarcity is **being outside the system** in ways that advantage the frontier and the new. That often sits in a weird regulatory area that could be gray, but that's where the edge of innovation lies.

I go back to poker as something that's slightly legal but also slightly illegal—it depends on how it's administered and how you play it. Sports betting is another one. Once upon a time, it was very challenging to do at scale; now you have DraftKings and others that have come to market.

The trend is you find that things that are a little bit gray do eventually move more to the light, and there's a path to institutionalizing that behavior. I think crypto is the same thing—it could look like it's outside the system, but eventually, it will have to participate in some kind of system with regulation.

That's where the edge is because you're early, you're there before everybody else, but the lines will merge. A bunch of the things in the resistance asset portfolio are anticipating ahead of that forward curve adoption.

The third thing is I see the biggest abuse of the 60/40 model being that you're essentially playing this arbitrage of **time value between the old and the young**. Much of interest rate arbitrage is redistributing wealth across generational timelines.

You need to find things where they cannot do that to you as an owner of an asset—where they can't play the game of yield curve manipulation to pull forward the spending that's rightfully yours between the old and the new.

That's another lens to appreciate radical assets. Part of why memecoin trading is so incredible is that eventually, many of these memecoins go to zero, but many stocks also go to zero—something like 25% of US-listed stocks eventually go to zero.

The difference is memecoins happen so fast—they're making things happen so quickly that you can't play the arbitrage of passing the hot potato to the next generation game. I think there's a subtle but philosophically acute point that young folks are making: "We're not going to play in the game of locking up my money for 10 years because I know what happens to my money when I lock it up for 10 years—you're gonna steal it."

So they're going to play in their little box where things are so fast and volatility is 500,000% because that's the part they know older people cannot play in. You actually can't come into this market at all.

The world is funny, but there's some reason why things happen the way they do. If you squint hard enough, you'll see memecoin trading is actually a wealth transfer from the old to the new, and I think there's something beautiful and poetic about that.

**Host:** You brought up a bunch of fantastic points. This idea of young generation intentionally moving to a place where there's no competition from older people might actually have a lot of wisdom behind it. You remind me of social media choices—I've heard from young people, "Oh, this social media is for old people, we don't want it." Just the fact that there are old people there is negative to them, so they want to move somewhere that's purely for their generation.

## Key Takeaways: Wrapping Up Jeff's Vision for Investors

**Host:** How do we summarize what we've discussed so far? The idea that the old way to think about portfolio is dead—it's been dead for a while. The technical reasons you might want to have a 60/40 are obsolete.

The biggest alpha is in understanding where the world is moving outside the traditional system. There's one aspect related to anticipating regulatory moves, anticipating what's on the edge of innovation and slowly getting approved and regulated.

There's another aspect—this social and cultural revolution that's happening. Old assets are just not exciting anymore. That's why gold has a lot of things going for it except it's not new for people.

One way I'd like to think about this: we have an ocean and an empty area of land, which is the alternative assets. We're seeing this gradual leak, which can turn into a large flow of water from that old pond into the new smaller pond. This is just a matter of time—a new world is getting monetized and capturing monetary value from the old world.

What I was learning from what you said is a lot of the alpha lies in understanding and anticipating these movements and flows. How would you summarize your theory and thesis? What would be some conclusions you think people would benefit from?

**Jeff:** I would emphasize that cultural capital is real. Financial capital is real, labor capital is real, but social capital is also very real. It's going to become more of a ballast away from the traditional system, and those who are able to navigate it—it's maybe the most important thing. We've just never seen it financialized the way we're seeing it now.

The other thing is, as I mentioned before, the line between qualified professional investors and retail investors is blurring. One of the things I'm really excited about at Bitwise is we're trying to ride that wave, bringing investors more options and choices to sophisticated products that can express their investment views more intelligently and tactically.

We have the **Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF** that will be launching in March. I think that's an interesting, timely, and significantly historically important product—not just for the Bitcoin community, but for those trying to stay ahead of the culture capital and understanding what Bitcoin will do to corporations. It'll do the same thing it's been doing to people—companies need Bitcoin for all the reasons we've found compelling at the individual layer.

We also have **options income strategies** coming live in March, taking advantage of the unique features about volatility that exist in crypto and harvesting that, monetizing that in smart ways that can give investors a different risk-adjusted return stream that's fundamentally different than being long only.

These products are essential because they're giving investors more financial toolkits to access the kinds of ways to build your own portfolio as you see it. The options income strategies will focus on MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Marathon—each individual products but all representing something important to the crypto arena, accompanied by very high levels of volatility.

This will help investors own their favorite long crypto equities but with income and a lower cost basis. Over a long period of time, that should be very valuable for somebody who wants to compound capital and take advantage of some path dependencies that can exist with highly volatile stocks.
