# The Oracle by Polymarket: Radical Portfolio Theory with Jeff Park

## Introduction

**Will Ward:** I'm talking today with Jeff Park, who's the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, which is a crypto-focused investment advisory.

Jeff, the first thing that caught my eye was your post in November where you talked about something that you call the "radical portfolio theory" - which is basically like a completely new interpretation of the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio. In there, in addition to stuff like crypto, you have this 10% basket which is like betting, professional gambling, sports betting, and prediction market trading. Then I started to get into your deep cuts and found you have a ton of experience on the crypto options market and looking at the MicroStrategy trade, which we cover quite heavily on Polymarket, and a bunch of other areas in our finance markets.

So welcome, and really happy we could connect today!

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, thanks for having me, Will. I'm so pumped to be here. Polymarket, to me, represents one of the most profound things that could happen in the information market. So I think everyone should pay attention to it, and I'm happy to be a part of that journey.

## DeepSeek AI and China's Deflationary Export

**Will Ward:** All right, we're going to get into the portfolio theory and MicroStrategy stuff, but I gotta start with kind of the big headline from yesterday and today - which is the Chinese AI model DeepSeek and the havoc that it's wreaking on our NASDAQ stocks and the panic over whether this model was much cheaper to train. So is this just going to slash demand for NVIDIA, which is holding on its back the entire tech sector and many people's retirement portfolios?

So you had this take about the sort of deflation that China is exporting by making things cheaper, and how that relates to some of your big picture views. So like, why don't we start with that? What's your take on DeepSeek?

**Jeff Park:** Happy to start there. One of the trends I've noticed in how people are kind of internalizing the news yesterday with DeepSeek is that perhaps Chinese technology is going to grow rapidly at a level where it's going to exert dominance over American exceptionalism. And I actually think that is a little bit, as you pointed out, misdirected.

The underlying risk that investors are actually worried about isn't so much about American dominance being eclipsed - it's more, I think, along the story of China continuing to export deflation. That has always been the biggest risk for most global macro risk assets and the number one concern that every investor is focused on today.

It is true that a lot of the growth assumptions embedded within the equities market to date has relied on the idea that the productivity growth enabled by these new AI technologies will actually be able to earn some nominal gains in the productivity sector. But ultimately, when you take a step back and you really think about it, the overarching history has shown that technology at the core is always ultimately a deflationary trend, right?

The goal of technology is actually always to make things cheaper and provide access at lower cost for more people to either learn things or do things with information in ways that wasn't possible before. So in some sense, nobody should be really surprised that it was always going to be deflationary. What I think shocked people was perhaps the pace in which it's happening, which is always the thing that humans misprescribe - the speed of change.

Ultimately, I think this is good news in the long run, which is that when you enable access for anyone to learn more and do things, it's always a great thing. Where I think it's also really interesting for companies like Polymarket and others is they're essentially benefiting from this tailwind in permitting the information market to be more accessible to people. Where now, with the backbone of crypto in addition to just learning, maybe now we have the chance to do something about it - which I think is really the reason why there's actually other ways to participate in the productivity gains outside of the traditional way we think about nominal GDP growth.

**Will Ward:** So I guess there's two follow-ups I have on that. There's this idea of like the AI trade, and there's kind of two pieces of it, right? There's the first piece where it's like everyone's going to max out on NVIDIA chips, and then it's going to trickle down to the memory producers. This is like the Cathie Wood research - I'm a big fan of hers - she's nailed this trade where people are going to be spending a ton more on all these picks-and-shovels AI things.

Then the second part of it is like, oh, if it's already here, it's going to be disrupting all these existing companies and being deflationary towards all these other entrenched markets. So like, do you think that we're just basically in that part B already, and we've already bought enough NVIDIA chips and now we're going to be seeing the deflationary part of it?

And then secondly, how do you connect that to crypto? I think in your follow-up to that, you said basically like Bitcoin is the antidote to these deflationary trades. So like, is that what you're saying - we're basically in this part two of the trade now?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, that's absolutely right. I think at the core, the reality is that technology growth is always a little bit path-dependent. What might have been the initial investment to get something from zero to one is not the thing that takes it from one and beyond.

What we don't know for certain today is just exactly how DeepSeek in itself was trained. I know there's a lot of stories coming through today, even wondering with some cynicism as to what is being represented by the company as being accurate or not. But the reality is, you can almost imagine that at some level, the kinds of inferences that people might be doing upon a base layer that may be more intensive is that it does actually maybe require less computation in the future and can be done differently.

So you have to almost imagine there's like a pyramid of data structure, and maybe the very foundation is actually the most intensive component, but all the other value-add that you can bring on top may actually require more extrapolation techniques that isn't just brute compute. And that's, I think, the part where it's really interesting for open-source crypto.

Bitcoin is a little bit different because I think of it as a store of value - as something being resistant to the deflationary trends in general as a store of value. But the rails of crypto is also fundamentally about permitting open-source capabilities with attribution qualities that then allow information markets to be consumed, priced, and maybe even traded upon in a way that is not intermediated by the world that we've known today with our infrastructure.

So I think that's the interesting part - data is an asset, and crypto is the thing that can potentially make data valuable, where new inference models can be built a little bit differently than the way that the foundational level today has been built.

## Radical Portfolio Theory: Why 60/40 is Broken

**Will Ward:** All right, so I want to zoom out a little bit and get to your overarching portfolio theory. So you had this amazing post, which we'll link to on your Twitter, about the radical portfolio theory. And you have a Twitter group that's like "how are we going to profit from the gamification of society."

So I think that's like the entry point to radical portfolio theory. So what is happening in the world that requires a complete throwing in the garbage of your 60/40 boomer stock-bond portfolio? Like, what are the forces shaping that?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, absolutely. So the boring answer as to why 60/40 is broken is that equities and bonds in general are no longer as uncorrelated as they used to be. That's the boring academic answer.

Now there's a reason for it, which is the root cause of what people perceive as productivity gains is becoming correlated, and a lot of it is driven by government expenditures and cross-border flows that is overwhelming what historically otherwise would have been measures of true productivity gains that equities are used to. That's kind of the boring answer.

The more interesting answer is that as a society, as a trend, I believe that we are entering into a world where the wings of outcomes are just getting fatter. So the things that are less likely or more remote of believability are becoming more likely or probable in ways that historically hasn't been the case, both financially as well as informationally.

That's also, I think, related to why there's such a loss of trust in institutions in general, because institutions maximize their survivability by being in the middle of the curve in the way that they command people's attention and believability/credibility. Once the wings start getting fat, that's a problematic trend.

### The Five-Point Manifesto

So why is that happening? At the very underpinning root of the radical portfolio theory is a manifesto with five points, and this is the guiding principle about how I think about the world that is changing.

**First:** We have to accept that there's really no such thing as an absolute truth in social sciences. So things like economics, where we talk about GDP as a certain measure, is not an absolute truth - that is a social science way to conceive of people to have an ability to converse intelligently and make intelligent decisions.

So at the core of this is that ***the opposite of misinformation is actually not truth, but it might rather be state-controlled information***. And this is related to the political energy that I think is now emerging, which is that there is a sense of rejection for what the media is controlling as state-controlled information, and people seeking other things that may deviate from that course - that fattens the wings on the information market.

**Second:** The other thing that's been happening is that it is absolutely true that the world is becoming more centrally managed than before. There's such growing unease, I would say, with the interconnectedness of the entire global economy, in addition to things we're seeing in financialization. The fact that the Mag 7 commands the financial markets in ways that indexing now forces participation in certain stocks in ways that historically did not means that everything is becoming more centrally managed.

And so you have to then almost imagine that part of how we're going to benefit outside of the 60/40 is being hedged against that outcome. So you have to think about outcomes with a little bit more autonomy and self-determination.

**Third:** The most important thing at the end of the day, I think, is that the monetary regime is fundamentally broken. So as we talked about, it's no longer the idea of this invisible hand that is driving rational economics of profit - it's really large cross-border flows of sovereign actors that are just overwhelming the efficient market.

And so this really underscores the importance of actually removing yourself from that global carry system. And to do that, you have to find assets that are not participating in that abundant manufactured liquidity model, which is why I think crypto is really interesting.

Because as financial assets represent this abstract monetization and manipulation almost of time and what it can do with a yield curve, hard assets actually remove themselves from that entirely because they can't really participate in that kind of financialization at the core. So information markets, I think, are also one of those.

**Fourth:** And so the ultimate thing is, the most important thing that I tell young investors is we have to think about the world in a probabilistic mindset. All of these things is increasing the volatility in the world, it's increasing the tails, and it's actually making things unknowable.

So rather than being deterministic about the world in a black-and-white way, you have to understand there's a spectrum of outcomes that's possible, and that people's belief system also lie in a spectrum. Having that probabilistic mindset is actually the most important thing to unlock your own productivity gains in an investing framework, and also actually just the world in general.

## Compliance vs. Resistance Framework

**Will Ward:** So the two concepts that were really interesting to me that you're organizing this portfolio around - it's not really, you know, the 60/40 isn't asset classes, it's actually compliance versus resistance. So you have 60% compliance and 40% resistance.

And the second way that you're constructing this is this idea of the global carry trade. So I'm familiar with the carry trade - you buy one currency for a low interest rate and put it somewhere to get a higher interest rate and just farm that differential. But I think you have a bigger conception of this global carry system. Could you unpack those two things - the compliance and then the global carry?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, so the compliance framework is dictated by three prongs:

1. These are centralizers that are affecting the investment market
2. They're generally public as well as utility ways that people are aware of what assets can be publicly traded, and that brings liquidity
3. And ultimately, what this permits then is a system for the global carry trade

What do I mean by the global carry trade? As I've said, the world is more interconnected than ever, and it's also happening in ways that are not just determined by trade, but by actual cross-border flows.

So take, for example, Japan. Japan actually is the backbone of how they are essentially permitting Americans to overspend, as now China is permitting it through their holdings of our bonds and dollars. But Japan also buys American equities because they need that as their part of the asset-liability ledger to imagine how they're going to potentially participate in the growth curve that they're financing through their cheap rates.

So the very fact that Japan also owns American equities, which they're funding also through their cheap rates that are on the backbone of low US rates, shows you they're all part of the same system. So equities and bonds, even though people think it's separate things - and once upon a time it might have been, right? Once upon a time, when there actually wasn't so much cross-border flows and sovereign actors, it could have been the case that they were a little more detached. But now we know for certain that they're actually not, and it's 100% of something.

### The 40% Resistance Assets

So the goal then is to find the other 40%. How can we define radically what the actual 40% is that's going to protect your portfolio from the world that we have known?

And in that category, the complexion has to then look totally different from the way I described compliance assets, right?

So one: instead of it being centralized, it might have to be decentralized, because that in itself will make it challenging to actually manipulate liquidity and manufacture liquidity.

Two: it may also have to look a little bit more private in nature than the way it exists in the public systems.

And most importantly, it has to require minimalist state intervention in the ways that compliance assets like equities, for example, have maximalist state intervention in how it's regulated.

And then you can imagine that's actually the hedge to the rest of what we probably have in most of our portfolio.

The reality is, historically, it's been very challenging to find those assets because if there isn't much publicity, if there isn't much liquidity, then we're talking about things that tend to be like low-leverage in general. But it also is the case that things with low leverage actually has the highest volatility, and that's where things like information markets and crypto can be really interesting.

You don't need a lot of leverage actually in the betting market to have the ability to earn outsized income, because the betting in itself is actually in some way levered without actually taking on recourse debt. It is about probability betting in ways that permits a different kind of payout.

## Examples: Compliance vs. Resistance

**Will Ward:** Can we run through some examples? So I thought that was really helpful in understanding that. So you have in your manifesto - you have, all right, imagine gold. If you have GLD ETF in your brokerage account, that's compliance gold. And if you have gold bars buried in your backyard, or even better, offshore somewhere, that's a resistance asset.

So if you have art on your wall in your house in the US or whatever, that's compliance. If you have art in a bunker in New Zealand, that's resistance. How does Bitcoin fit into that? Like, would you say if you have Bitcoin etched into a piece of metal somewhere, that's resistance, but if you are sitting on Coinbase, that's compliance? Or how do you see crypto in that?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, ***there are two parameters in defining whether an asset is compliant or resistant. One is the investment characteristic, but the second thing is actually the operational custody***, which is the point that you're alluding to. We haven't spoken about it yet, but I consider that as another way to imagine compliance versus resistance outside of the investment characteristics of the asset.

Here I think the point that I'm alluding to really is that in a world of state maximalism - which was kind of what I felt the energy was for the last four years here in the US - you need to remove yourself from that system somehow, right?

Because as someone who's experienced financial crisis multiple times - once at the start of my career actually in 2008 at Morgan Stanley, but also when I was much younger in Korea during the Asian financial crisis when the IMF bailout required that citizens donate their gold to essentially save their motherland - those things show you the custody model is not yours really unless you own it yourself.

So even GLD is ultimately a paper certificate to a lien that allows you to do a lot of cool things with it as a result, but it is a little bit challenging that in the worst-case scenario of actually needing it, that's actually when it's most unavailable.

And so owning assets directly in a custody model is one way to future-proof yourself if you believe the world is heading towards more of a maximalist vision of state control.

So even the Bitcoin ETFs, I consider them as compliant assets because they are able to play nicely in your IRAs and your Roth accounts, which is all great. But if you really think that you might find yourself in a world where the tail risks are so profound that those things are not as relevant, then you might have the idea that as you store gold under a mattress, you may actually likely want to consider a similar storage model for crypto.

## Professional Gambling and Information Markets

**Will Ward:** Let's get more into the professional gambling or information markets part of the bucket of the portfolio. So the thing that I guess - one of the overarching things of the resistance part is these seem like very much things that you either need to develop a personal skill, like either - I guess you can bankroll a profitable poker player or something, but those opportunities are few and far between.

I could grind for my career and become a professional poker player - that would require a lot of effort. I could buy property overseas, which is a pain. Learning to be a good prediction market trader is a pain. So all those things seem like they would be much harder - you can't just buy an ETF of someone that's going to make profitable bets for you or something like that.

So these are all things that require a lot of personal work and investment. Like, how do you think about that? Will it ever be able to just scale into one of these neat "I click a button and I'm getting resistance," or does it always have that personal component to it?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, 100%. It in fact should be hard. It should be energy-requiring because that's actually the scarce asset in itself.

The problem with the way that we think about the world in financializing quantitative easing and the global carry trade and all the financial repression we've seen is that the liquidity transformation that the government's able to do is so easy, right? It's easy to print money. And so of course it can scale.

But you can't scale things that are genuinely hard to do and requires real human capital or social capital to permit an outcome that is actually differentiated than somebody else's.

So you're absolutely correct that this category of what I call professional gambling requires energy - tremendous amount of energy and learnings.

### The Spectrum of Gambling

Now, that being said, just taking a step back, when I use the word "professional gambling," I sometimes hear from folks that it's a sin because of the word gambling. And so the thing that I also try to emphasize upon people is that gambling also exists on a spectrum. One thing can be obviously good, and one thing can be obviously bad, and many things sit in the middle.

So for example, slot machines - slot machines are in general probably the most horrible thing that exists within the gambling category because it doesn't actually give you informational edge for wins. You're literally just playing because you have an addiction and a mental problem at some level. That's bad. That's like a public health thing.

Now, on the very good side, insurance is good, right? And insurance is a kind of way to think about the flip side of speculation, and people are making intelligent bets to provide insurance as a service. And I think most people will find insurance to be a worthwhile endeavor, especially when we have catastrophic events that's difficult to model outside of the accountability of one's personal balance sheet. So insurance is good.

And so then there's many things that kind of sit in the middle. And things like poker and sports betting or betting on prediction markets, to me, are kind of things in the middle, where how you determine whether it's positive EV or negative EV to you really depends on your own skill, because actually that's an information market.

Poker is a closed system where some people win and some people lose, but generally the people that are winning are because they're good at something. And you can almost interpolate that to the same thing with prediction markets or sports betting, where informational edge is actually a very powerful thing.

And so the idea of professional gambling as a de facto blanket statement "bad" is, I think, a bad take.

### The Future of Tokenization

And one of the things that I'm really excited about is, to your question of like, can we find more models to outsource these kinds of investments to experts that can manage on your behalf - I really believe that's actually the next wave of tokenization.

I think many people are solving for tokenization for product-market fit today, so they're taking money market funds to sit on-chain and buy T-bills or whatever. That's fine, but the reality is those things kind of just work fine in the existing system.

And what you actually need tokenization for is to access the long tail of assets and skills. So if you want to launch a hedge fund today, you can do it. It's a private fund, you launch under some 3C1 3C7 exemption, and you can go to market. It's a lot of work and it's institutional, but you can do it. And you're betting then someone else will manage your money for you on your behalf to generate alpha.

Now, can you launch that effort for a sports betting fund? It's challenging. And it's challenging because the very idea of compliance and resistance is meeting in the gray area of permitting these kinds of activities.

But if I think about why it's so gray, it's generally rooted in causes like AML or KYC or things that can be solved through blockchain. And so the next unlock of tokenization is - an imaginary Jeff Park might launch a fund that does sports betting, and it is actually completely transparent in ways you'll be able to see your investors as well as the activities, and you can kind of then participate.

I think those are the kinds of things that have to happen to go from a step function of zero to one for broad adoption where people find real utility.

So my long-term thesis is that, yes, there's going to be experts, they're going to have capital formation strategies around these resistance asset strategies, and I think tokenization will play a big role in permitting that.

## Options Trading Mental Models

**Will Ward:** So the next chapter is funds or even AI agents or funds that are doing these things for you. But before we get there, I mean, I'm really curious - you have this big background in options trading and have put in the work to get good at probabilistic thinking and forecasting.

So what are the skills and mental models from your past career that you would be taking and applying to either sports betting or prediction market trading? What are your favorite pieces of that toolkit to bring into this world?

**Jeff Park:** Sure, sure. So one of the timeless lessons that I've learned and I continue to practice and share with everyone to also benefit from is that we need to understand the limitations of our own abilities and the human mind.

The human mind is really great at many things, but it's a little myopic. It's actually not very good at predicting very extreme events, and it's also not good at predicting the timeline in which these extreme events can happen.

And options give you a way to play that because there's a term structure to it, and there's basically a skew to it as well in terms of moneyness that you can bet on.

### The Two-Barbell Strategy

So the number one rule that I share with investors and friends is you almost always want to play betting in two-barbell strategies. You want to play the 10-delta to 30-delta outcomes, and then you want to play the 70-delta to the 100-delta outcomes.

What do I mean by that? You want to play the 10-delta to 30-delta because 10-delta means you have the chance to have a 10x payout, right? Of an option that can go in the money. It's very improbable, but it also is priced this way because many people think it's improbable, and that's actually where the greatest convexity lies.

When something that's 10-delta goes in the money, the gamma pickup there can be massive. So it's easier sometimes to bet on very improbable things that are possible than trying to bet in the middle of the curve where the delta might be 40 or 60, and you're kind of wavering back and forth. Because actually at that point, there's a lot of information symmetry - people are betting on outcomes that are hard to know because of the democratization of that information, so your edge is gone.

And the 70 to 100 is another delta that's worth playing because 70% means that there's a fair amount of certainty that an outcome will likely happen, but also enough that people think it might not. But you may then develop 100% conviction that it's going to happen, and the 70 to 100 is actually the easiest way to clean up the terminal value of a bet.

### MicroStrategy NASDAQ 100 Example

So an example there that I might mention is in Polymarket in November and December, there was the market to bet on whether MicroStrategy would be added to the NASDAQ 100 index. And that market was volatile and had fluctuated, as I saw it, from sometimes under 50% to maybe a peak around 70-75%.

In those windows, for me as someone who's been paying attention to what was available publicly, it felt very evident that MicroStrategy would be in the index by the deadline. And if you believe with that conviction, the 70 to 100 in three weeks' time is one of the best ROI you could imagine for the usage of capital.

So that's what I mean by also playing the long end to the terminal value. And I think that's how you think about probabilistic investing - you want to play for the wings when you can, when it's mispriced the most, when there is information asymmetry.

**Will Ward:** One criticism of prediction markets that you hear a lot is that they overprice - you know, something that may have a 2% chance is going to be priced at 10%, or people tend to overvalue these long-shot bets. Does that create any problems when you're trying to get these huge returns on the wings?

**Jeff Park:** I think ***most prediction markets - it's an options market in general - overprice likelihood of events because that's actually the way insurance models work, right? People are betting usually to hedge for an outcome if the market's developed and people are willing to pay a premium for insurance***.

Now, I don't know how that would apply to Polymarket today in the sense that - are people hedging their investment account using Polymarket as a hedge to an outcome? So for example, if you thought your equities portfolio is going to benefit tremendously by having exposure to Trump-favored stocks, might you then use Polymarket to hedge for an outcome on a beta-adjusted basis that Harris would win? That's insurance, right? You're actually no longer betting on whether Harris is winning - you just want insurance in your portfolio.

So insurance always tends to create that premium to be a little bit larger than the market would efficiently price. That's also why in general, call selling and put selling is a very profitable endeavor until you shouldn't be doing it. But that goes to tell you the time value of optionality is in itself a valuable thing.

That being said, I think there are still many things that are relatively mispriced in ways that Polymarket also permits so many permutations of the kinds of bets that are available.

### Parlay Betting Example

So for example, one fascinating market that I was watching around the Trump election wasn't just whether Trump or Harris would win - there were other bets I would almost call them parlay bets, where you could bet on Trump winning certain swing states but actually losing certain other swing states. And those markets should move with actually the big markets, and they're not always efficient.

I've actually noticed that they're not, and so if you can actually play for relative value trading within the same betting market, that could in itself be a way to trade for payouts that isn't just about buying cheap options. Cheap options also exist in spreads.

## Institutional Hedging with Prediction Markets

**Will Ward:** I'm fascinated with this idea of being able to take one financial options position in the public markets and then be able to hedge with the specific event on Polymarket. And you're talking about individuals doing that. Do you see a world in the future where institutions are doing this, where hedge funds and companies are hedging their intrinsic business risks or the risks of competitor drops X product or something like that, where these markets can actually just trade full-blown institutional size for businesses or funds?

**Jeff Park:** In an ideal world, 1000%. You almost already see it with the weather market in terms of how people are trading catastrophe bonds and reinsurance contracts, where these kinds of event-driven risk also need to be pooled and hedged differently. So there are ways to play weather that is totally discretionary in nature.

Now, the beautiful thing about weather is no one can control it, so actually that makes it a little more - well, I don't know, some people... you know, that's true. Yes, there are some ways I think that's also now being challenged. But in general, the notion of it being nature meant that it felt exogenous to human manipulation.

Now, your question around can we trade a product release or not - those things get trickier, right? Because these are events that are pushed by other individual actors, and the question of then market manipulation becomes a little bit sensitive on what events are betable truly with perfectly fair information and what are not.

But I think if you take, for example, elections - elections should be perfectly fair and nobody should be able to influence the outcome in a way that can drive inside knowledge. If you believe that that's a perfect market, that should be something investors can bet on and hedge. To me, that makes perfect sense that that kind of market will be relevant for institutional investors as they think about risk-on and risk-off sentiment to their equity holdings and their particular sector holdings.

## MicroStrategy Deep Dive

**Will Ward:** All right, let's move to MicroStrategy, because this is an area we have a ton of markets on. I'm fascinated by this trade, and in some ways it seems totally obvious, and in some ways, once you get into the weeds, it completely baffles me as someone who's not really up on convertible bond trading and all this esoteric options part of it.

So let's just start at the basic level, right? There's this guy on Twitter who his whole thing is like "I'm signing up for every credit card possible and just buying BTC," and he's up some crazy amount with Bitcoin more than doubling this year. So is MicroStrategy just like the publicly traded corporate version of that or what? Like, break down the differences between this guy yoloing and Michael Saylor.

**Jeff Park:** Many, many differences. Huge differences. And the devil's, of course, in the details.

The first difference I would call out is MicroStrategy is paying 0% to borrow, whereas the guy on Twitter maxing out his credit cards is probably borrowing at double-digit yield. So already that is in itself incorrect and different from Michael Saylor's thesis. You're not borrowing for free.

The second thing is that if you are borrowing on your credit card, you're actually taking some kind of personal recourse to you, right? And there's actually ways that could be problematic if you were to then file for bankruptcy. And in Michael Saylor's case, the bonds are offered unsecured, so actually there is no Bitcoin collateral that is being pledged at all in the ways that he is borrowing. So that also is a little bit different in the lien that can be expressed upon one strategy versus the other.

But the biggest difference ultimately is the guy on Twitter is a one-man show. He has no other counterparties that is providing an inefficient market, so you're just borrowing at expensive rates to buy.

### The Arbitrage of Institutional Mispricing

And what Saylor actually tapped into is an arbitrage of mispricing amongst institutional investors, which is: how do you convince somebody to lend you money for free, and how can you scale that to levels that ultimately benefit the equity holders? And he's been able to harness that energy by then actually rolling out these programs that do so.

One of the things that's really obvious to investment managers is that there's been a lack of performance generally in the credit market. I mean, high-yield bonds are - I think the spreads are maybe at about 300 basis points today, which is shocking to see with where actual risk-free rates are. So credit markets are hurting for performance relative to government yields.

If you give them something that is credit in name but actually it's Bitcoin, and you can juice your performance to up 200% as a fund manager - this goes back to what I was talking about the Mag 7, where you must own an index of something to outcompete your peers.

Every convertible bond manager probably should have a little bit of that because if you don't have it and everyone else has it and it's up 200%, you're out of business. Your LPs are going to call you and be like, "Hey, why did you not own the thing that's up the most this year that's up 200%?" And if you said, "Well, I didn't like Bitcoin" or "I didn't understand it," well, either way, you didn't deliver the performance.

So there's actually a scarcity element to not just Bitcoin, but the kinds of papers that investment managers want to hold. And Saylor, by creating these convertible bonds, has created some scarcity value around these bonds themselves. Not everyone can have it, and that kind of financialization, I think, is uniquely done that maxing out your credit card is not the same thing.

### Why Bond Buyers Want MicroStrategy

**Will Ward:** So let me see if I have this right. The reason that the bond buyers will buy MicroStrategy bonds is because it has the potential to convert to equity in MicroStrategy that has this Bitcoin basket attached to it. So in a sense, these bond investors are able to buy something that gives them exposure to Bitcoin, which is the huge upside, and they need that because all the other alpha in that market is super low?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, essentially that's correct. There's two things to take away.

One is everyone really, I think, is gravitating towards wanting to own Bitcoin in some format. Personal investors are already expressing it, corporates are expressing it, sovereigns are expressing it. So the trend is that having a little bit of exposure to Bitcoin could overall be good for your portfolio allocation.

Now, there are reasons why people can't own it, and it tends to be the case that the structure doesn't permit it. So even for those who can't buy Bitcoin directly, they had often looked at MicroStrategy as a substitute good to buy for their brokerages that wouldn't let you buy the Bitcoin ETFs. And that's a proxy bet - of course there's basis risk, but it's good enough.

And I think for convertible bond investors or credit managers in general, of course they can't go buy Bitcoin - that's outside their mandate. But if you can buy a credit that gives you exposure to Bitcoin, then that changes the game.

### The Volatility Arbitrage

The other thing is the convertible market is valued upon volatility. And because Bitcoin can be very volatile and MicroStrategy in particular can be very volatile, there's a lot of arbitrage that can be done where as a bond holder, you can also go short the equity and you can collapse and make that premium over a period of time by trading the gamma.

So actually it's a smart thing. Most people in the convertible market understand how to trade gamma. And here you have Michael Saylor's vehicle that has the most amount of gamma that the world has ever seen. And it's not actually just betting on Bitcoin going up - you're betting on the volatility of Bitcoin and when and whether you can harvest the gamma around it by running a delta-hedged portfolio in a continuous manner.

So it appeals to a different kind of investor that historically would not have been able to access that kind of return with any other corporate credit instrument available.

### What About the Equity Shareholders?

**Will Ward:** So one way that I try to look at it is through the different parties, right? You have Saylor, and you said that Saylor himself is protected because he's buying this vehicle that has no personal recourse to him, so he's doing well. The convertible bondholders we talked about them. But what about the MicroStrategy shareholder equity holders themselves?

They're constantly getting diluted by printing more shares to buy more Bitcoin. So are they losing on this? It seems like someone has to be losing in this trade. Are the shareholders of the equity themselves losing out, or what does it look like for them?

**Jeff Park:** Well, you might say the loss or losing is being distributed across the capital structure. So for example, the convertible bondholder is losing a little bit by having the conversions happen out of the money. So when they become equity, they're not becoming equity today - they're becoming equity at multiples higher than where the stock is trading today.

So they're essentially forward-subsidizing their eventual conversion today for those shareholders. Now they're happy to do it because even at those prices, they're up, and it's a question of now a trade-off between volatility and risk-reward.

And that's the beautiful thing about MicroStrategy - MicroStrategy, almost better than anybody else, has perfected the ability to offer many choices on risk preference.

You may have seen that preferred equity is now on the table for issuance later this week, which will be the first convertible preferred equity that MicroStrategy will offer. And that's another way to bring in a new cohort of investors who are basically interested in earning a cash yield or a nominal explicit coupon yield today, but willing to have the optionality to convert way out of the money.

Right? So in this case, with the price at $350, if it were to say the strike price is $1,000 a share, it's good for the common shareholders actually to say somebody is going to come in and convert at $1,000 because they're diluting it at a higher price than the price of $350 today if you were an investor.

### The Fundamental Thesis

So what does this all mean? It actually works only because you believe Bitcoin is going to go up. If Bitcoin was not going to go up, then actually it wouldn't work because that's the fundamental thesis about why you're financializing the volatility of this asset class.

So actually, who's losing? The people who don't own Bitcoin are losing. They're the ones that are subsidizing Bitcoin's gains. That is then redistributing the return profile and risk preference of Bitcoin's gain into these different parts of the capital structure based on the risk preference they've expressed at the onset of the trade.

So the losers are those who are not holding Bitcoin, and perhaps just general global debasement as a whole.

### Bond Collateralization Question

**Will Ward:** The other question I have about this is this idea that the bonds are not collateralized by Bitcoin. So I understand that you can sell the bond with no collateral, but in a situation where MicroStrategy can't repay, the whole point is that the bondholders could force the company into bankruptcy, at which point they own all the assets, right? They own everything that would be left over, which would include the Bitcoin. Have I got that wrong, or is the Bitcoin truly off the table in an extreme downside scenario?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, I think that's correct. That's correct, unless there was some exorbitant fraudulent conveyance type of maneuvering that happens sometimes within the credit world. That is the base assumption.

I think the nuance there is actually most of the time, credit doesn't default and go bankrupt when it's impaired - it restructures. So chances are, if there was a very dire situation in the capital structure where you thought the equity was being impaired, it's actually more likely that the debt will be restructured and refinanced and rolled in a way that permits this company to still exist in form.

Now, the shareholders may have to give up some of their equity to the new creditors who want participation for taking that additional risk. But the reality is that it's not so black and white. It's not that if Bitcoin goes to $30k, the company goes bankrupt. There's many steps that happen along the way in which restructuring happens almost always for companies, unless you really, really thought the terminal value of a business was zero.

And if you don't believe Bitcoin's terminal value is zero, I would guess there are many people interested in refinancing the rollout and trying to take a little bit of the equity piece if you could.

## MicroStrategy Risk Factors

**Will Ward:** So let's go to this - is there any Bitcoin price at which you would say, based on your evaluation of it, MicroStrategy would start to get in trouble? Are they in trouble if Bitcoin just stays stagnant and doesn't continue to go up? Or is there any place on the downside, or sorry, on the extreme upside, where MicroStrategy just owns too much Bitcoin and it becomes this weight around the neck of Bitcoin in that it's less decentralized and becomes too big of a player?

**Jeff Park:** That is certainly one of the limits of the MicroStrategy thesis as it's currently standing. This is a Saylor-specific risk, as I like to think about it. What are the ways that MicroStrategy could fall out? And it won't be because of a liquidation of the Bitcoin holdings.

Rather, it is more likely to be that question, fundamentally, as you asked: how much is enough for MicroStrategy to own of the total supply available for Bitcoin without compromising the entire experiment and thesis and ethos behind the network and its constituents?

And treading that line carefully will be important because at some point the company will have to change in its financing arbitrage strategies. I think there's a lot of things you can also do with Bitcoin, by the way, as an internally managed strategy that generates yield, and that could be one evolution of MicroStrategy in the future. But that limit will be hit, and the question is, what is that ceiling?

### ETF and Options Market Dynamics

The other thing is there's a lot of financialization happening with MicroStrategy as the underlying. So if you look at ETFs like MSTX or MSTU, these are 2x leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs, and those flows can also sometimes overwhelm the underlying market dynamics of MicroStrategy itself, just like the options market can sometimes be more dominant as a force than the underlying market of the stock itself can be.

And so the thing that I pay attention to the most is, one, the velocity of how quickly implied volatility changes for MicroStrategy, because that is ultimately the fuel in this complex as to how people are monetizing that premium.

And the second point is actually global rates. This is where maybe it comes back to the radical portfolio theory. The beautiful thing about MicroStrategy's arbitrage is that it is taking advantage of yield repression. The fact that people are willing to lend you at 0% to buy Bitcoin itself is an incredible thesis.

So if you thought in the future rates are actually going to come down in the Trump era - that the 10-year is not going to be at 4.7% but maybe it will move with the short end of the curve closer down to 3.5% or 3% - that's also a great outcome for MicroStrategy.

So there's actually a two-way bet. You're betting on not just the price of Bitcoin going up, but because it's a corporate wrapper that can access financing, you're also kind of betting on rates going down. So it's actually maybe the only vehicle of an investment you can express two views in one as a secular trend, which I've called it being both short and long global carry at the same time.

### FCoin Strategy Comparison

**Will Ward:** And last question on this - have you heard of FCoin and fart strategy? The latest DeFi... So this was in Bloomberg. I was aware of it at the launch, but it's essentially a DeFi version of MicroStrategy on Solana but for FCoin, where it's this on-chain entity that is trying to just issue its own debt and accumulate as much FCoin as possible.

Like, is this just one of the next flood of these things that are coming out? There's one for ETH, but what do you make of that? And is there a difference between what that's doing and what MicroStrategy is doing with the financial markets?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, I think - I don't know it super well, but I do remember seeing Soul strategies. I'm assuming it's like a similar interpretation of that using FCoin.

The major difference is that MicroStrategy plays within the compliance framework, right? It's in the 60%, FCoin's probably in the 40%. And there's actually a lot of benefits of being in the 60% - one, which is the ability to get margin, the ability to cross-collateralize.

So there's actually a lot of capital efficiency that comes out of MicroStrategy where an investor can actually start pledging some of their non-crypto equities or related assets as part of the way to fund the trade. So if you're a tech TMT fund manager and you're trading MicroStrategy with Apple, you're getting haircuts and benefits that you're not going to get on FCoin.

So structurally, I think the capital efficiency is very different.

And then the investor base is diversified in crypto - sorry, in MicroStrategy - than it is in crypto generally with memecoins, right? Meme coins are trading on trend and momentum, and those things can be heavily autocorrelated in its price action, where when things are good, it's really good, and when things are bad, it's really bad. And that's actually the kind of thing you don't want that much leverage in.

The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is actually you have a very diverse group of investors playing with very different risk-reward outcomes and timelines in which they're betting, whereas memecoin trading tends to be very low-latency, short-term trading, which actually makes it difficult to put leverage into the system.

**Will Ward:** So what I'm hearing is we need to expect an FCoin IPO at some point in the near future?

**Jeff Park:** If we have an FCoin ETF, you may have to revisit this question with me in another year or two.

**Will Ward:** Okay, all right, we'll put that on the calendar.

## Polymarket Hot Takes

**Will Ward:** All right, let's move to the last part, which is just Polymarket hot takes. So I'm going to share my screen, we're going to click through some markets on Polymarket and get your rapid-fire takes on it.

### Will a New Country Buy Bitcoin in 2025?

**Will Ward:** All right, let's go through the first one. "Will a new country buy Bitcoin in 2025?" That's sitting at 65% odds right now, down from a high of 73% a couple weeks ago. I think you're pretty bullish on this one, so what do you think the true odds are? And do you have any stabs at what country or countries it might be?

**Jeff Park:** So as I've shared with you prior, my favorite parts of betting is the 10 to 30 and 70 to 100, so this is squarely in the middle where I have very little edge to offer. But in general, I tend to lean bullish on this one. I do think you will see news of a new country buying Bitcoin this year.

I think with all the tailwind that is happening from a regulatory perspective, it seems more likely than ever that a new player would emerge. And actually, many have emerged already. The question I think is about how you declare it, and that's the level of contract specifications that people really need to study in terms of like, how will you define whether a new country has bought Bitcoin? If a Middle East country is found out that they bought Bitcoin rather than declaring it, how does that affect the actual contract payout?

These details matter greatly, and I always tell people on Polymarket to read the rules. The rules are super important.

### The Nation-State Game Theory Framework

Which country is a fun question. I published a framework in the past about how to think about the nation-state game theory of strategic Bitcoin reserves, and I have a Venn diagram actually to explain it, which is that you have to be in the middle of three circles to be the most likely candidate.

**One:** You need to be slightly adversarial or neutral to US policy and partnership in general. The reason I say that is because if you're a US partner, it's very unlikely you're going to be able to front-run the US. You will have to announce it with global coordination. So it has to be, by definition, someone either adversarial or neutral.

**Two:** The second circle is that it needs to be a country that is youth-heavy, because politically that's where the win is going to be. If your country is not young, they're probably not that interested or invested in the outcome of it. So having a young population that gives you a political win is actually kind of important as well.

**Three:** And the third circle, and this is the most nebulous one, is that you need semi-open capital borders. So it can't definitely be closed because if it's a closed border situation and you embrace Bitcoin, then you've actually kind of wrecked the psyche of your nation in ways that capital flows will be challenged.

So countries like China and Iran, for example, I don't think can ever do it. But it also has to be semi-open in the sense that it can't be totally open because those things tend to then also be countries that have partnerships with the US. So that's why it's its own circle.

If you look at it and think about the countries that are in between all three of them, the countries that I published were **Argentina**, **Nigeria**, and **Turkey**. I think those are standout and important countries.

You also saw recently Bhutan made an announcement of actually participating more, and I think Bhutan's actually a great example of how it fits in all three: young population, kind of a semi-open capital border where it's not entirely closed but not totally open, and at best neutral to US policy.

So my money's on Argentina, Nigeria, and Turkey as far as interesting big economies go. So we'll see.

### US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve

**Will Ward:** Next one we've got - two markets on the US Bitcoin strategic reserve. There's a "Will Trump create in the first 100 days?" and there's a "Will he create it in 2025?" So right now the 100-day market is trading at 15% chance. It was at 50% on inauguration day and it's just been down only since then when there was no executive order or explicit mention of crypto on inauguration. And then for by end of 2025, it's at 56% now, so down from around 60% earlier.

So what's your take on the Bitcoin reserve, and when do you think it'll happen?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, this is actually a fantastic example of the spread trading opportunities that I mentioned earlier. I paid attention to this market actually pretty carefully, to the point where the 100-day odds was really high - I think it was as high as 50% - and the odds of Bitcoin getting adopted in the first year was at 60%.

So that kind of told you that if you thought Bitcoin being adopted as a standard would be after the first 100 days but actually happening in 2025, that odds was 10%. So now we go back to how I love the 10-delta bets. To me, that's an amazing bet because you're getting actually nine months for much cheaper than the first 100 days.

And actually, what you saw post last week is exactly that market coming to life, because the odds came down for the 100-day tremendously, but actually the odds for 2025 went up. I think now it's at 56% for 2025.

And so that's actually been the right spread trade because then that payout would have been fairly nice. So yeah, I definitely don't think it's happening in the 100 days. I wouldn't even buy it there at the 15%. But I'm also not super bullish on it being a 2025 event either. So I think the opportunity was actually the spread trade two weeks ago and leading into it. I'm not sure now if there's anything super knowable in this market.

### Strategic Reserve Requirements

**Will Ward:** Yeah, the other thing about this is the rules on this one. So the US - it's not enough for them to just not sell the Bitcoin, it has to be officially held as reserve status. So that seems like a much higher bar to cross. Do you have any thoughts on Bitcoin in terms of just - is it enough that the government doesn't sell it? Do they need to be buying more? Do they need to buy more and actually say that this is backing the US dollar? Do you have takes on which way that will or should play out?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, if I remember correctly - and I might be wrong - the contract specification for that bet forced that the US has to buy new Bitcoins. It's not enough to redesignate its current holdings through the bankruptcy estate claims as a part of the strategic reserve. He needs to actually go out and acquire new Bitcoins, if I remember correctly.

**Will Ward:** Yes, yeah, confiscating Bitcoin does not count as holding Bitcoin reserves.

**Jeff Park:** Yes, that component I think is really challenging. I think it actually requires a lot of multilateral conversations within the administration of a government to go to execution mode. So that's why it feels to me, at the federal level, it's not time. There's going to be, in my opinion, a lot more signaling with global partners in the US trading partners before we see this happen.

We're going to have to see news that come out where Japan starts talking about it in coordination with the EU, with the United States. There has to be some coordinated action here, in my opinion. The US can't just go rogue and do it alone because it'll piss off their entire trading partners, especially Japan, who, as I've mentioned before, is funding most of the US consumption today.

So until you see those signs, I think it's challenging to think that market has any room to succeed this year.

### XRP and Solana Reserves

**Will Ward:** Got it. And we have these other markets for some of the other coins. There's an XRP reserve in 2025 trading at 18% and a Solana reserve trading at 19%. This was - there was this story maybe a week or two ago where it was reported that Trump not just Bitcoin, but now he's considering kind of made-in-the-US crypto coins, including USDC, for holding as part of this crypto reserve basket. Do you have any thoughts on that market, or do you think it's appropriately priced there?

**Jeff Park:** I think it's way too high. I think if you thought Bitcoin was going to be at 55%, the relative ratio to those altcoins should be a lot lower, in my opinion, because there's a little bit of path dependency, right? In the question of if there's B, but if there's B, there's no A. And Bitcoin has to lead the path. And if Bitcoin's at 55%, the combined probability would imply that those outcomes are actually more fragile.

You know, relative to Ripple versus Solana, I think is kind of interesting to observe. I think one way that Ripple has a slight edge is that it doesn't have components within the way Solana exists in the consensus mechanism that might appear to be a little bit cleaner from an adoption perspective.

But I think it's just very challenging to tell because these will all be driven more, I think, by political agendas. And I would almost think they're both not likely, personally. I would rather see a Bitcoin reserve than a reserve that requires an altcoin manager to sit at the Treasury.

### MicroStrategy Markets

**Will Ward:** All right, so now we've got back to the MicroStrategy. We have three markets on MicroStrategy. We have - I think their Bitcoin holdings now are around 477k, so we have a market "Will MicroStrategy hold over 500k Bitcoin before March?" That's trading at 62%. And then their markets on MicroStrategy distress, so "Will they announce bankruptcy by May 31st?" at 6%, and "Will they have to sell any Bitcoin in 2025?" and that's at 13%.

So how would you think about that in terms of the upside and downside cases for MicroStrategy?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, I think the one that is most obviously not going to survive is MicroStrategy selling Bitcoin. I think that's almost unlikely to happen, mainly because there is no debt maturity that's happening in 2025 to force a conversation. So that, to me, feels like it's overpriced. There's just no catalyst for this to be an outcome. There's no event trigger.

Acquiring 500k coins by March - is that March 31st?

**Will Ward:** Before March, so February 28th. So we got four weeks left.

**Jeff Park:** I think it's possible. Saylor's bought Bitcoin around 10,000 a week or so more recently. So if you have four weeks left, you could imagine hitting there. 10,000 is a little bit higher than historic, so historically, if you thought it was around 2,000, we might not meet it. But based on the last two weeks, that's the pace.

And then with the preferred equity issuance that's coming, that's a solid addition which will price later this week. So he initially wanted to raise $2 billion there. If he succeeds, that's 20,000 right there.

So I think it's more probable than not, and 62% is a great market. I think this is a very efficient one here.

### Bitcoin Price Distribution for 2025

**Will Ward:** The last one we have - this probability distribution for Bitcoin price in 2025. I think this is an interesting one because you can see - let's see, I forget what Bitcoin's at right now, but assume it's still around $100k. You have the odds for it to hit $200k sometime this year is 25%. The odds that it gets cut in half to $50k is 22%.

I think I like to keep an eye on that sort of skew - is there more upside skew or downside skew? But how do you think about overall Bitcoin price targets for this year?

**Jeff Park:** Yep, so number one disclaimer I always tell people to read on these things is how the observations are recorded. So I used to be an exotics trader at Morgan Stanley, and there are three ways we would talk about expiration and observations of barriers:

1. **Continuous observation** - so will it hit it at any time throughout the year
2. **Close of day**  
3. **European expiry** - right at the end of 2025

And all of those things actually have incredible impacts on the probability assignment. You can imagine just continuous observation is the best one because it's possible Bitcoin can hit it and then come all the way back down, and you're observing every tick, every candle.

Here, as I'm reading it, it resolves to a yes between anytime, so it's a continuous observation of 2025, which is different from derivatives and the ways you can price digital options, which is European expiration.

Of course, that being said, I think these are all too high. For example, the $150,000 is pricing a 51% chance. The last time I checked Deribit for a digital call option $150,000 for European expiry for December, the odds were closer to 18%.

So then you're telling me that actually the 51% odds of hitting $150k is happening intra-year but not the end of the year at three times? But it feels really high to me because I think Q4 is probably going to be stronger than Q2 and Q3 based on just crypto seasonality. And so I would discount that 51% versus Deribit at 18% for a European observation.

### Arthur Hayes' Bear Market Prediction

**Will Ward:** Are you - so I know Arthur Hayes had this big article that came out yesterday where he's calling for kind of a quick bear market which gets Trump to turn back on the money printer, and then we're at $250k by the end of the year. Do you agree with that, or any sense of how things are going to play out macro-wise this year?

**Jeff Park:** Yeah, I think the number one headwind is the 10-year rates and dollar strength. There's no mistake, no doubt about it. And I think Bitcoin too has been relatively stretched in its current valuation, which is really admirable, and it shows you that there are differentiated investors coming into Bitcoin regardless of where rates and dollar strength is.

But I do tend to agree that until the real economy is fixed in the problems that it exists today - mostly in the 10-year market affecting real estate - I do think that the first 100 days is probably more interesting and tradable than the middle of the curve in Q2 and Q3, where it's actually very challenging to probably put these things into effect.

So I tend to think Q1's going to be stronger, Q2-Q3 is a little challenging, and Q4 we'll probably see some momentum.
