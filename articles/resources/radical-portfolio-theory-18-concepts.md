The most intriguing ideas from Jeff Park's Radical Portfolio Theory:

**Paradigm-Shifting Concepts**

- **"Time is liquid energy"** - Reframes all financial assets as either energy transformation (scarce, real work) vs. time manipulation (printed liquidity)
- **60% Compliance / 40% Resistance** - Revolutionary reframing of diversification around your relationship to the system, not asset classes
- **"The economy is now a function of the market, not vice versa"** - Complete inversion of traditional economic thinking

**System-Level Insights**

- **All traditional assets = "100% long global carry"** - Stocks, bonds, real estate are the same leveraged bet disguised as diversification
- **Professional gambling as legitimate asset class** - Poker, Polymarket, sports betting with edge as "energy transformation" investments
- **Custody model determines asset class** - GLD ETF = compliance, physical gold bars = resistance (same underlying, different system exposure)

**Counterintuitive Investment Logic**

- **Illiquidity as a feature, not bug** - Too much liquidity makes assets part of the system you're trying to escape
- **Bitcoin ETF vs. Bitcoin spot** - Same price exposure, fundamentally different portfolio functions
- **Human capital as resistance asset** - Your skills/knowledge as hedge against system collapse

**Historical/Macro Revelations**

- **90% of Americans were self-employed in WWII, now 10%** - Demonstrates rapid centralization trend most people don't recognize
- **Sovereign defaults are normal** - US never defaulting is the historical anomaly, not the rule
- **The dollar's "Triffin dilemma"** - Serving domestic vs. global needs creates unsolvable tensions

**Practical Provocations**

- **Children as metaphorical 40% allocation** - Scarce, resistant to authority, antifragile, energy-requiring
- **Culture tokens (Hermès bags) = legitimate investment** - Scarcity-based assets that can't be printed
- **MicroStrategy preferred (STRK) + Bitcoin** - The "if you could only own two assets" radical portfolio

**Philosophical Breakthroughs**

- **"Nothing you thought you knew can be foundation"** - 2008 crisis as formative experience questioning all assumptions
- **Energy cannot be printed, liquidity can** - Fundamental distinction that reshapes how to think about value
- **Probabilistic vs. deterministic thinking** - "Bots are deterministic; AI is probabilistic"
