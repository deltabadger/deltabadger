**Danny:** Lyn, it's great to have you back on the show. This is like your hundredth appearance on What Bitcoin Did. The audience knows you, the audience loves you. But we're here with Andy, who this conversation is going to be interesting. Andy, is MicroStrategy a Ponzi scheme? You've not been on the show before though. Do you want to start by just introducing yourself? Tell everyone a bit about you and your background.

**Andy:** Sure. I've been in traditional finance for 39 years, starting my career at Salomon Brothers, which was one of the big investment banks where I ran a global equity derivatives business and have been a derivatives trader all my life. Then I ran my own hedge fund for a number of years, then worked at Bridgewater Associates as a senior analyst there, and then as the chief of strategy of macro strategy for Brevin Howard for a number of years. For the last five years, I've been servicing hedge funds with my own research product in which I focus on macro.

**Danny:** Okay, so you've had a long career in sort of traditional finance. We're obviously going to talk about MicroStrategy and treasury companies today, and we'll probably get into stablecoins as well. But before we do all that, what is your take on Bitcoin? I think it'd be good for both me and the audience to know that ahead of this conversation.

**Andy:** Sure. I am a strong believer that a portfolio requires diversification against debasement of fiat currencies. I really learned that from Bridgewater and the teachings they've had regarding their all-weather portfolio and more broadly their general concept of what money is. They focused, as did I and as I still do, on gold as that monetary asset that protects against debasement. So I'm totally bought in on that idea as a necessary thing for everyone who is saving fiat to own, or whose expenses in the future or future liabilities are in fiat, needs to own.

As it relates to Bitcoin, I've been aware of Bitcoin since 2015, probably maybe even a little earlier, and have been tracking it and watching it and finding it interesting. I think I first became very closely aware in 2017 when it peaked at around the low 18s and have been following it ever since. I would own some for the reasons that I own a significant amount of gold relative to my AUM, and I'd replace gold with it because I consider it to be digital gold.

I'm still not comfortable yet - and this is my own problem - but I'm still not comfortable with its correlation to risky growth assets like stocks, NASDAQ in particular, and what I consider some measure of speculative excesses. So I don't own any. I tried to - I bid 84,000 for some and then passed as it came to my bid and then lowered my bid down and just haven't participated. But it's a completely valid idea.

**Danny:** Well, I think the audience will probably be glad to know that you've not completely dismissed Bitcoin as an idea, and the treasury companies are obviously an entire other beast on top of that. So Lyn, why don't we get into the debate you two had on Twitter? This all came about after your comments on an investor call with MicroStrategy. Do you want to kind of just lay the context out and explain what happened there?

## The Evolution of Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries

**Lyn:** Sure. I've been covering MicroStrategy since they started their Bitcoin accumulation treasury strategy in August 2020. I've also been long since then. It's been a small part of my analysis compared to everything else I do. So I focus a lot more on Bitcoin broadly than I do on MicroStrategy, as well as broader equities and macro, as many people know.

Over time, the thesis has changed a little bit. We kind of see the evolution of it over time. So first I was like, "Okay, it makes sense. There's finally a stock that will own some Bitcoin." So in certain types of portfolios, you can access that. Then they began levering it, which I found interesting. As they did their second or third tranche of leverage, I was like, "Maybe it's getting a little bit too levered" - I'm a pretty conservative investor.

But then they started issuing equity because they had a pretty high MNAV at the time, and I was like, "Okay, this is actually de-risking it to some extent. They're adding more on their equity side." I increasingly saw that they were navigating this way. I also think the executive team has been strong.

My thesis throughout the 2022 bear market was that they would get through it. They did. Since then, we've kind of seen them shift more from convertibles toward preferred. I continue to be long. For people that follow my research service, I tend to trim the exposure when it hits kind of euphoric levels, like particularly high MNAVs and everyone on Twitter/X is talking about it. But I've still stayed with a position to let the house money ride.

I think broadly treasury companies make some degree of sense because if you have an appreciating asset - and Pierre Rochard wrote about this back in 2014, the idea of a speculative attack - Bitcoin was tiny back then and he kind of pointed out that as it gets bigger, it's inevitable that we'll see some pools of capital find ways wherever they can to short fiat currency and be long Bitcoin. I think the thing about treasury companies is they can do it with better types of leverage than most other pools of capital have access to, which is interesting and gives them an edge.

I think that by the end of the cycle we probably will see some treasury companies fail. I think there will be low-quality ones that get over their skis. Anytime you link leverage with something, you're increasing the risk. I do think the highest quality ones are valid.

This particular discussion happened when I went on MicroStrategy's earnings call as one of their analysts. I actually asked the bearish question of the group, which was basically asking about stress testing during the next bear market - like what kind of bear market are they modeling or thinking about as they design their capital structure. They provided their answers. I generally agree that their new preferred, which they're pretty excited about, is hitting a sweet spot that the market wants.

In one of my two threads, Andy and I went back and forth a little bit because I'm generally in the cautiously optimistic camp around these treasury strategies - depends on the specific company in question and the quality of the management team and everything else - whereas he understandably has a more critical view, which I think is healthy. I'm certainly critical in some aspects of some of these businesses. That was kind of the genesis of this conversation.

**Danny:** Okay, so maybe before we get into Sailor's response to the question you asked on that investor call, Andy, you can just lay out your kind of overarching thesis on these.

**Andy:** I think what's important is that while I tweeted a few things back in the bear market in late 2022/2023 regarding the NAV premium, I really only became pretty active in thinking about MicroStrategy when it hit above $500 in late November 2024. At the time it was real, so I've spent my entire career doing arbitrage and in particular capital structure arbitrage, in which I understand what the asset is and understand how its liabilities are pricing that asset.

MNAV, which is the market value of the Bitcoin compared to the enterprise value of the company, is an important thing for arbitrage. We're not talking about book value like for most companies. We're talking about the market value of the liabilities being excessive relative to the market value of the assets. So that made me want to short. Now I don't trade personally or professionally at this stage in single names, but the idea was the MNAV was extreme, and that's really been my bias ever since.

The questions that I continue to have - well, the basic premise is that yes, I agree with Lyn, there are some corporate advantages. There are also some disadvantages, particularly around tax, but significant advantages for issuance if you're a corporation to hold Bitcoin compared to an ETF. An ETF should trade at - does trade at - zero MNAV, well at NAV. So I consider MicroStrategy to be a slightly advantaged capital structure with a worse tax structure that should trade potentially at a premium to NAV and can lever. Now you can lever your Bitcoin ETF as well. So that's been my big framework.

One other important thing though is I think it's very clear that the idea prior to Bitcoin futures and prior to ETFs that you could buy Bitcoin in a stock was a genius idea and made complete sense that it should trade at a premium because no one could buy it. There were people that literally couldn't buy Bitcoin. So the whole run-up of MicroStrategy to its $500 price peak to me made some sense as people didn't have other alternatives.

Now that there's a liquid futures and ETF market, I see no value in the NAV. So my big question that I hope can get answered is: how does a Bitcoin strategy company create income - not capital gains, but income - on their assets? Because income is earnings. Capital gain is just a change in the NAV. If it were to be the case that I could understand how MicroStrategy can create earnings out of its Bitcoin holdings that are excessive, that are worth a premium, then I could see some sense regarding the idea of a multiple to NAV.

## Bitcoin Per Share & MNAV Flywheel Risks

**Danny:** Well, I mean, Lyn, we should probably just throw that question straight over to you. What would you say to that?

**Lyn:** Well, I would say that unlike an ETF, MicroStrategy and other treasury companies that are operated well tend to increase their Bitcoin per share through these strategies, through this kind of debt and equity issuance strategy. So you're paying a premium over the Bitcoin they have, but then you're also expecting this per-share Bitcoin to increase.

Now there are different ratios that analysts have come to use, basically trying to figure out how much of an MNAV to apply based on forward - how much they expect Bitcoin to increase per share. I've actually raised the concern that the problem with that is it's recursive, because the higher their MNAV is, the faster they can increase their Bitcoin per share. So that flywheel is really good on the way up but can also just unravel very quickly when sentiment changes. It's different than say evaluating a company based on cash flows from operating a pipeline business or something.

So while there's merit in that analysis, it's a new form of analysis and it's inherently just challenging. My general view has been that I don't know what the right MNAV is. It certainly depends on the company. For example, MetaPlanet is smaller, is in a jurisdiction where there's a really big tax arbitrage, which is different than the United States, so they're actually tax advantaged there. They started from a smaller base, so they've had very high MNAV and have grown very quickly. It's come down more recently. So I think that MNAV is somewhat context dependent, partially based on how much you expect them to be able to kind of arbitrage this.

Generally speaking, as they get bigger, we should expect the MNAV to gradually compress because trees don't grow to the sky. Now they can continue growing, just that after a while that MNAV generally starts to compress. That's so far what we've seen in the market. But I do think that an MNAV above one makes sense when you can attach this longer duration debt to Bitcoin and therefore get through periods of cyclicality, at least if managed well and conservatively, compared to the way that hedge funds lever or the way that retail investors might lever. So I think it's worthy of a premium.

I would like to see eventually more cash flow generating businesses have Bitcoin on their balance sheet. The kind of history of the space - so MicroStrategy did the approach. They actually then ran a number of conferences called "Bitcoin for Corporations," trying to get other corporations to do it. We saw Tesla dabble in it. Block got in to some extent. We didn't really see a lot of other companies with existing operations decide to add Bitcoin. Instead, in this cycle we've seen a number of companies that kind of spun up to do the strategy, as well as increasingly around the margin some existing companies do it.

So I think there is a bigger market for companies that just use Bitcoin as a treasury asset while also having separate cash flows. But then clearly there has been demand for five years now, and I think ongoing, for a levered kind of pure play Bitcoin entity. Then I think the main questions to ask are: how do you value that? I generally err toward conservative. And two, how do you manage the risk so you don't have a very large blowup, especially among the larger ones in the market?

## Zombie Companies vs Profitable Treasuries

**Danny:** So Lyn, you started this by saying that you're not necessarily bullish on all treasury companies and you think that some will fall by the wayside. Do you think the companies that are essentially zombie companies that are doing a Bitcoin treasury play are going to be unsustainable going forward? And what we need is real companies with real business models adopting Bitcoin?

**Lyn:** There are somewhat different types of zombie companies. In some ways, the perfect candidate to do this is one that's like a value stock that's cash flow positive but doesn't really have any growth prospects to add Bitcoin. That's really interesting, and we haven't really seen a lot of that.

Truly zombie companies that have like no cash flows - that's a much harder sell. Generally speaking, so far we've seen that the market certainly does not like unprofitable companies - companies that are losing money - to adopt a strategy because they view that as a distraction and a risk versus their Bitcoin approach.

So I certainly think it makes sense for companies to at least have profitability like neutral, and I think there is a market for ones with cash flows. They don't have to necessarily have growing cash flows. Really at that point, Bitcoin competes with other uses of capital like buying back shares, paying dividends, paying down debt. They can employ that as one of their potential strategies for what to do with their excess earnings over what they require for reinvestment.

**Danny:** Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, Andy, sorry I interrupted that. Did Lyn's answer clear anything up for you?

**Andy:** No, not at all. Unfortunately, the question I asked was: why have - besides the appreciation, which listen, anybody corporate levered unlevered, anybody who wants to speculate on an appreciation of a thing can part with their cash and buy that thing. But assets throw off income, particularly corporate assets.

Every company decides how to spend its cash. And Michael Saylor, I guess all these companies would have been better off using their cash to buy Bitcoin. Well, some bought their shares, and that was a pretty good return on investment for Microsoft, for instance, who Michael tried to convince to do a Bitcoin treasury. I don't get why someone would choose to use their cash to buy an asset given all the assets they have in Bitcoin. So that's one.

And then secondly, if they were to use it as an asset, besides its appreciation, I've heard no good reason for owning it.

And one other point that I want to come back on - Lyn mentioned the flywheel of, hey, part of the reason why you have a NAV premium is because you can continue to harvest more Bitcoin by selling more assets when you're doing ATM stock sales. Listen, I think that's genius. And absolutely, Michael, you should do exactly what Michael Saylor is doing because it's genius. If you can buy $2 of Bitcoin for $1 - more relevantly, buy $1 of Bitcoin by selling $2 of value in your shares - you should do that all day long. And Michael Saylor is doing it all day long. He's harvesting the MNAV.

The problem is the investors are the suckers in that case. And when I use that word, people will say, "Well, I own MicroStrategy since 10 or 20 or 30 or 60 or whatever and it's 400 now. I win." No, you haven't performed for months since the peak. That whole MNAV expansion is by and large over. So I don't see anything more than new holders of the common stock generating returns for the old holders of the common stock, which is a Ponzi scheme.

**Danny:** Is that not the reason that he's brought in these preferreds though, to try and help the common stock?

**Andy:** Right. And I think it's interesting the preferred - and the preferreds are legitimate investments. I happen to think there's some hair on them in some ways, in particular the STRC in terms of its ongoing use, which I think everyone's very excited about. But the preferreds are essentially - the ones that are not convertible are essentially leverage, and the company's not particularly leveraged. I don't actually have any problem with them levering up their Bitcoin, but it doesn't mean that there should be an MNAV. It just means they're going to take dollars over here, STRC dollars, and buy Bitcoin over here. Their assets and liabilities are going to be identical. And if the market goes up, they win. If the market goes down, they lose. But you can do that with IBIT.

One last point - Lyn mentioned term leverage. There's a deep market for long-term ETF calls. Now go and buy a 20%, an 80% in-the-money call for two years and you get all the leverage that MicroStrategy has without paying the MNAV premium.

**Danny:** Lyn, I want to get on to - or deeper into - if MicroStrategy is a Ponzi scheme, but before we do that, do you have anything to respond to there?

**Lyn:** Sure. I mean there's a number of points there. One of the earliest ones was: why Bitcoin? Why buy Bitcoin with cash? Historically, the answer is because it's the best performing thing you could buy with your cash, pretty much. And then the thesis going forward is that it's going to continue to be one - either the best or one of the best things you can do with your cash, especially that it's not a security. So there's with US stocks, there's kind of a limit on how much securities you can have in your asset mix. It doesn't apply to Bitcoin, which is a digital commodity.

So the combination of high expected returns based on those who - generally speaking, those at MicroStrategy and those who invest in MicroStrategy - are bullish on Bitcoin. So I certainly wouldn't recommend a Bitcoin treasury strategy holding for those who just aren't particularly high conviction long-term bulls in the asset.

**Andy:** Do you think there's a valid reason to have high expected returns on Bitcoin based on historical returns?

**Lyn:** Not just on historical returns. I mean, I employ a number of analysis methods to determine what I expect Bitcoin to do. I still think that the total addressable market of what Bitcoin can address is much larger than the current size. So from my expectation over the next 5-10 years, I do expect Bitcoin to still have high returns - not the returns that when you go from a billion dollar asset to a trillion dollar asset, but I certainly think it can 5x and 10x from here, and we'll see how the numbers shake out in the years ahead.

It's also the risk situation is different than before. So when Bitcoin was tiny, it didn't even have the liquidity for like a corporation to buy it. It didn't have the regulatory clarity in many cases either. And so now that the tax treatment of it has improved, regulatory clarity has improved, and it's a big and liquid enough asset, the expected forward returns are not as explosively high by most analysis methods than they used to be, but the probability of beating your...

**Andy:** The question I have really isn't whether you're bullish on Bitcoin. I like Bitcoin. I can understand the bull case. I like gold. That's why I own it. The question is, you could say that about any number of things that have done very well in the past and have valid forward-looking returns. The question is: why should corporations be doing that for their shareholders under what their the corporation has? By the way, you're great at it. Michael Saylor's great at it. Lots of other people are great at it. But what is the competitive advantage for a company - an operating company, not an ETF, not a treasury company, but an operating company? Where's their competitive edge that allows them to - that their shareholders would say, "Yeah, I get why you are buying Bitcoin versus anybody else, or for that matter, I can do it on my own. So why are you doing it for me?" Like where's the edge?

**Lyn:** I think the main thing is that Bitcoin is the first asset that can actually compete with equities long-term in returns. So prior to this, when corporations had excess capital, they generally decapitalized themselves. They would give it back to shareholders. They would pay it in dividends. They would pay it in buybacks. They would sometimes make acquisitions for the sake of acquisitions because they don't know what else to do with the money. That's often a criticism that especially some tech companies tend to do.

You know, one of the downsides is that that makes the company more vulnerable in the future if they don't have something good to do with it - kind of like how households want to save for unplanned things in the future. Generally speaking, corporations want to save for unplanned things in the future, and there's just not been a great vehicle for that. Even gold, because gold over the long arc of time underperforms high-quality equities, it's hard to justify holding a lot of it on your balance sheet longer term if you're a company that's trying to be in the top third of the S&P 500 returns or something like that.

**Andy:** But I think you're saying the same thing. I think you're saying that you think Bitcoin is going up. I'm saying a different thing, which is: why should I trust a company that manufactures, creates software, does whatever it does as a business to have the expertise that you do?

**Lyn:** Well, I think in many cases you shouldn't. And when companies adopt the strategy, many of them don't get very high MNAVs because the market says, "Well, who are you?" Right? So they look at MicroStrategy and they say, "Well, these people have been doing it for years now." They look at say MetaPlanet and they know the people running that. I mean, I know the people running that, and they think that, "Okay, I'll trust those people to manage this well." So it's certainly a company-by-company basis there, and some of these companies have hired Bitcoin analysts, Bitcoin experts in various capacities to help them do the strategy. Then the market assesses: do they think they have the right people on board to help that company with the strategy?

But basically the answer is: one, in the near term there's an arbitrage the market likes. But two, longer term, as Bitcoin kind of grows and becomes less volatile but still has the absolute scarcity aspect to it, which is desirable, it's one of the few assets that I think there's a reasonable case it can be made that it is able to keep up with equities over a pretty long span of time, if not outperform equities. Therefore, if a company doesn't want to fully decapitalize itself - it doesn't want to say, "Okay, we're going to take all of our excess capital above what we need for working capital and give it back to shareholders," we want to plan for a pandemic lockdown or a big new competitor comes to our market, we need to make major capex to change our or pivot our business - they want to have something that they can hold for 5-10 years as part of their asset mix. And I think Bitcoin brings that in a way that other assets haven't.

**Andy:** I hear all that, and I guess I just don't understand why a shareholder would want a corporation to do that for them when they can do it for themselves.

[*Advertisement break for Iron mining company, BitKey wallet, and Anchorage custody services*]

**Danny:** Well, the funny thing about this, Andy, is I think the argument you're putting forward is a very Bitcoiner argument. So like treasury companies are definitely not greatly received by everyone in Bitcoin. There's a lot of people that do say we should just buy and hold our own Bitcoin because that's the point of this thing. Like you two are definitely on the right curve of the bell curve and I'm on the left. But like if you had to say why would you trust them and what's the benefit that you get from the treasury companies? I think obviously two different questions, and why would you trust them I think is very valid. But what their sort of the reason they can potentially outperform you just buying Bitcoin, I assume, is just the access to capital markets. Is that right, Lyn?

**Lyn:** Partially it's the access to capital markets. Yeah. That they can do certain types of leverage that others can't, especially those that don't want to make one-year or 18-month bets on the price, but just want to say, "Okay, this company plans on doing this for the foreseeable future." And they want to maintain conservative leverage ratios in debt that's not really callable during a bear market as long as they don't get liquidated in some capacity - they're unable to make coupon payments or something. And so I'm going to let them do it is how many pools of capital think.

Now, I'm with you that I don't think anyone should say, "Okay, sell your Bitcoin and go buy a Bitcoin treasury company." I think that there's one, there are larger pools of capital that just for a variety of reasons can't own Bitcoin. Sometimes they can't even own the Bitcoin ETFs, and so they can go out and buy companies or either their equity or their bonds that give them some degree of Bitcoin price exposure if say a fund manager happens to be bullish on Bitcoin. There's now a capacity to do that.

And then two, if you're that company themselves and you're not - you do any other business, it's not Bitcoin, could be software, could be gasoline pipeline business, whatever the case may be - and you say, "Well, we're decapitalizing ourselves. We're giving back cash to shareholders," which makes sense. But if you want to have something that we want to hold, say 20% of our retained earnings in something longer term for unexpected events or to grow over time, that's certainly one of the things that they can do.

In MicroStrategy's case, and they've actually talked about this, when they were a software company, they had flattish income. They were no longer a growth company. It was a very competitive market. A lot of their competitors had gone out of business. They were up against really big conglomerates at that point. And they generally found that nothing they did was enticing to the market. So buying back shares didn't excite the market. Holding a lot of cash didn't excite the market.

They've even talked about how they would eventually start losing executives that go on to work at things where there's bigger and more scale. And so by becoming a larger company partially through their treasury strategy, they were able to keep and retain really good executives.

So sometimes decapitalizing yourself is the answer because it's kind of a decision that the investor will make better use of that cash than the company will. And that's certainly better than a company holding it and then misusing the cash. But there's also an argument to be made for putting some of it into something that can appreciate long-term and give the company survivability through problematic events as well as become larger over time, which then potentially down the road could result in larger acquisitions than they could do without having done the strategy.

And then investors might say, "Well, I like the underlying business and I like the fact I'm bullish on Bitcoin. I like the fact that they're holding Bitcoin. I'm not going to say let them manage Bitcoin for me. I'm also going to hold Bitcoin. But if I'm looking at the universe of stocks I can own, that's an interesting strategy because they can employ in some cases a little bit of leverage or not. They have cash flows or not. And they're doing something with their Bitcoin that can allow that company to thrive through multiple cycles."

**Andy:** Yeah, I guess I'm wondering - so before Bitcoin existed, I think it is pretty interesting that over the last decade, set of decades, corporations have accumulated lots of cash that one could call savings, like rainy day savings, versus just regular operating cash that they need to manage to pursue their business, particularly the tech companies who've generated such cash flow. But in no case have any of these companies thought of their cash as an appreciating asset. And they've had lots of alternative assets to buy.

I just don't - I think they think, and maybe I'm completely wrong and this world is now going to change - I think they think that cash is literally a rainy day asset and shouldn't take risk because God forbid Bitcoin falls, they take risk, they buy Bitcoin and Bitcoin falls at the same time their business weakens - that's a pretty disastrous outcome for them. So I think they think about cash in a very different way than I think you're saying, which is they don't - they consider it a rainy day asset. They're not considering it an earning asset, and so they keep some.

Now most companies, most operating companies don't keep a lot of cash because they don't have a lot of cash. So I guess my question is - so let's break it down also. Firstly, there's the - is a treasury Bitcoin treasury company that is 98% Bitcoin treasury an ETF that deserves a NAV? And secondly, is there demand for Bitcoin for companies that have nothing to do with this type of activity that are just looking at Bitcoin as an asset? And I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing.

So the first, the second thing - these companies don't invest their cash at risk. I'm not sure why they would, and more relevantly, and I've said this before, they aren't good at it. They aren't good at betting on Bitcoin. Should they hire people when you yourself as a shareholder can just buy it yourselves? Only if it's true that you really can't as an individual buy Bitcoin would you ever give company ABC money to buy Bitcoin on your behalf, even if they're able to leverage it?

Now, on the other side, you've got this treasury company that trades at a premium to NAV. What should that NAV be? Should it be 2.5x, where Michael Saylor is happy to sell as much as he wants? Or closer to one, or like many closed-end equity funds, trades at a discount to NAV? I'm not sure, but I think two is high and one is probably about fair.

## What's a Fair NAV Premium?

**Lyn:** So a couple different questions there. I generally think that it depends on the company, right? But for a mature one that's at the scale of something like MicroStrategy, I generally prefer the sub-2 MNAV. I think above one is still the right answer for these companies because I think - I guess my thesis is we're probably earlier than you think in terms of how much capital can access Bitcoin comfortably versus what these companies are making available. And so I still think that there's a runway ahead.

You know, one of the tweets I did a while ago was I pointed out that like even if MicroStrategy's MNAV compressed all the way to one, it still would have been a major outperformance over the past five years for those that owned it because basically they accumulated so much Bitcoin per share that even after the MNAV compresses, they've done well.

**Andy:** Here we are. What would you say going forward? And what I'm hearing is very bullish outlook for Bitcoin, which I totally get, and some conservatism in terms of whether an MNAV is sustainable long-term for the biggest investors - sorry, for the biggest companies like MicroStrategy - and opportunistic when you are going to sell MNAV at high and assuming you're then going to buy the Bitcoin and then do that swap back into MicroStrategy when the MNAV is low. That's a totally sensible strategy. I could completely agree on all those ideas.

**Lyn:** So I think MicroStrategy is aware that there are different type investors, and that's why they're offering so many different things because there are those that want exposure with less risk. There are those who do want to make all these bets, and they can benefit from the fact that MicroStrategy is very liquid and volatile. So it's a really good kind of trading vehicle for those.

My answer to that is I would generally recommend caution for those buying in at high MNAVs. Now what a high MNAV is will depend on the company and the market. So for example, a high MNAV for MetaPlanet is a little bit different than a high MNAV for MicroStrategy. Like I tweeted out back when MetaPlanet had like a 6 MNAV, I was like, "I like the company, like people running it. Wouldn't personally buy it at like 6 MNAV." It's since compressed. It might - we could have this conversation a year from now. Maybe it's high again. I don't know.

So for risk management purposes, I would generally recommend people avoid high MNAVs. I wouldn't necessarily claim to know what band of MNAV makes sense, with the caveat that generally speaking, the bigger and more mature that market is, you generally should expect gradual reduction in MNAV. I still think we're at the phase of the market where one is not the right answer either. I think something in the 1.5 range makes sense. It could be between 1.2 and 1.8. I don't really have a super specific view because I think there's a lot of unknowns still ahead of us. I generally view above two is where I'm increasingly disinterested, at least in US-based treasury companies.

**Andy:** I think that's a totally reasonable thing. And for one, I don't even look at these other Bitcoin treasury companies at all, though I'm starting to pay attention to the Ether one, Ethereum one - Ether, I don't even know the name of these things. But as it relates to MicroStrategy, I don't know if it's 1.2. I don't know if it's 1.5. At 1.2, I think there's going to be an interesting dynamic on whether people think it'll go to one or below. So you know, all that stuff is really, really hard.

I guess the what I still don't quite get, and this is the thing that I'm really struggling with - what's the endgame as it relates to making money on your asset? Is there a business case in which you can generate profits - not appreciation profits - by having a large stake in Bitcoin that non-corporations can't do?

**Lyn:** Partially, so one of the methods - and it's not really at scale yet and I don't think it will be in the next five years, but it is being done - is for example, you can use Bitcoin on the Lightning Network while retaining custody of it to facilitate payments. Basically, you provide liquidity. There's a whole technical thing we can go into, but how it works, but for example, one of the companies that's doing it is Block Inc. They have some Bitcoin and they also are active in the Lightning development space, and they talked about this at the Vegas Bitcoin conference. They're generating pretty high ROI in Bitcoin terms with Bitcoin.

Now the scale is not there yet because Lightning as a payment network is still small in the macro sense. It does billions in volumes, but it's still small in the macro sense. And specifically, the percentages you get from moving around those billions are small.

But if we talk about a future where Bitcoin is quite big and Lightning and similar things are quite big, that is a potential future income source. You know, right now there's not really demand for borrowing Bitcoin in many cases other than through financial arbitrage. Should Bitcoin become bigger, more used as money, there could be lending aspects of it that get interesting. But right now it's firmly more about the appreciation - the idea that fiat is going to keep debasing, Bitcoin's going to go up, and that's how the companies...

**Andy:** Which is why I like Bitcoin, but I still can't get comfortable buying a corporation that's supposed to earn money with my money. I'd rather buy the physical Bitcoin or an ETF.

**Lyn:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Danny:** I think the yield on Lightning is going to be an interesting one because like you say, Lyn, Block came out and I think they said they were generating about 9%. They're kind of in a silo where they can set the fees themselves, which makes it hard to know what the exact figure will be because I think River have also published a report which said they get something like one and a half percent and they run a very large Lightning node. So who knows what the actual figure will be, and I do think we're going to see some Bitcoin treasury companies come out and try and do that as a way of generating profit.

But one thing I do want to go back to, Andy, because we started this conversation with you claiming that MicroStrategy was a Ponzi scheme. Like that kind of came from Lyn's question, which we've not actually got into, which was how does MicroStrategy perform in a bear market? And in the investor call, Lyn, Michael said that if it dropped 80% he thinks they're fine, 90% they may have to pause some dividends. Andy, can you just lay out what you mean precisely when it comes to it being a Ponzi scheme?

## The End Game

**Andy:** Yeah, it's a very simple thing, which is a Ponzi scheme is a situation where past investors are paid money, paid return from proceeds of new investors' money. And that's all it really is. And so what I'm referring to isn't the NAV. The NAV isn't a Ponzi scheme. An ETF isn't a Ponzi scheme. You get - you take the money from investors, you go buy the asset. All good. No Ponzi.

What is a Ponzi is when you have interest that you're paying and have no income to cover that interest. Literally no income. That's why I also asked when's the income coming from. That's not appreciation. So there is no hope. Again, this is why I said what's the future income of the treasury company? There is no hope of paying the preferred dividends without new proceeds from issuance. And that's a Ponzi scheme. That's it. There's no two ways about it.

**Danny:** So Lyn, I'm curious on your take on this because there's a great Bitcoin analyst called Checkmate, James Czech. He's a good friend of mine, and I think he does really good analysis on this, and he calls these treasury companies kind of "Ponzi adjacent." I'd like to know your take on it.

**Andy:** That's exactly what I'm saying. There's the ETF and then there's the no income paying out interest with no hope of future income.

## Are These Ponzi Schemes?

**Lyn:** Yes, I think there's two levels of this. On that first level, it is true that they're paying out existing coupons and dividends with the expectation and ongoing issuance of new capital. That part is true. And that if you define a Ponzi scheme as just that, that's correct.

Now for example, if you look at the SEC's website for like red flags of a Ponzi scheme - and the reason I was familiar with this resource is because when I years ago wrote an article for why Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, which is different than a Bitcoin treasury company - people would say it is. So I kind of did research and I point out, for example, the Ponzi scheme red flags according to the SEC are high returns with little or no risk, overly consistent returns, unregistered investments, unlicensed sellers, secretive complex strategies, issues with paperwork, difficulty receiving payments.

So generally speaking, when you think of the word Ponzi scheme, usually it comes with some degree of obfuscation, secrecy, fraudulent assumptions with it. And that's the part I would say, of course, there's not any of that here.

**Andy:** So I disagree with that. I think you look at MicroStrategy's most recent marketing document where they talk about their PE and where they talk about their earnings relative to everyone else. That is deceptive, completely 100% fraudulent. Just because it has recently become GAAP to consider appreciation of Bitcoin treasury assets as earnings doesn't mean when you say, "Hey, I am the biggest earner in the whatever, the top whatever earner in the S&P 500," that that is not a fraudulent statement because if the market falls, they will be the biggest loser in that quarter in history. And they are marketing it as recurring earnings that deserve a multiple. That is fraudulent.

**Lyn:** Well, I would say I wouldn't - I'm not sure I would call it fraudulent, but I don't agree with the charts that show their PE comparison either. It's their company.

**Andy:** How can you not say to them, "Hey, you're committing fraud here by marketing your shares as having a recurring earnings."

**Lyn:** Well, I think recurring - it depends on what time frame you're looking at. They expect - probably comparing it to the biggest companies on earth that have decades of recurring earnings, and which is why I agree the comparison is not valid. I wouldn't go so far and say fraudulent. It's not valid.

**Andy:** How can they do it?

**Lyn:** Well, so I'm trying to - so basically, if when I look at say a highly cyclical company, a company that has periods of earnings and periods of losses, any investor would generally assign a lower PE multiple to a company like that for a correct reason. If there's a company like a Mag 7 tech stock or even a really big mega cap like Costco, if you look at the PE of what people put on Costco, I think it's excessive, but clearly there's an argument that investors use when there's a premium that investors pay for smooth growing earnings. They pay a much higher multiple for that correctly.

And so when someone makes the argument that based on current GAAP earnings, MicroStrategy has a PE of like five or something, and then they say, "Well, our competitors have 20, we would also have 20," I generally would say right along with you that I don't view that as an accurate comparison because you're comparing a highly cyclical expectation of GAAP earnings and losses, even if Bitcoin does continue to appreciate but at a bumpy pace, versus a very smooth expectation.

Now fraudulent - I mean they - it is GAAP earnings. They're following a certain accounting standard. So I personally wouldn't use that term. But I definitely would say that I wouldn't - that's not how certainly not how I would evaluate the company. I would instead look at other metrics that I use to evaluate the company.

**Andy:** Let me ask you a question on that then. Why is MicroStrategy doing that? Why is the company putting out slides like this? Why are they doing it?

**Lyn:** Well, one thing to keep in mind that was one slide out of over a hundred slides. But why are they doing it? You'd have to ask them. I mean any company is trying to put their best foot forward and say, "This is why you should own our company." All sorts of different companies do it. That's their approach. That's not the slide I agree with. I think they had many good slides in their deck. That's maybe one of a couple slides I wouldn't make - certainly wouldn't make the argument for.

**Andy:** Okay, fair. I think it's - I think it will - so let me just say this. There are no Ponzi schemes that fail. Sorry, that don't fail. Ponzi schemes fail, and that's when they become known as Ponzi schemes. Bernie Madoff was never a Ponzi scheme until he failed.

And so it's possible that Bitcoin rallies forever. It's possible that there's never a down case where and they continue to create recurring earnings. And in that case, MicroStrategy will never be declared a Ponzi scheme.

**Lyn:** Well, there certainly will be down periods in Bitcoin. I think even Bitcoin bulls, any rational one would say.

**Andy:** My point is that as long as the - and this is why the adjacent part is the key bit - Bitcoin will - MicroStrategy will never be a Ponzi scheme as long as the ETF continues to appreciate, the Bitcoin underlying asset continues to appreciate. Whether it's bouncy or not is sort of irrelevant. It'll be a Ponzi scheme when they no longer have access to financial markets to compensate their preferred shareholders, their coupon shareholders, and they must sell Bitcoin to do that. That will take the MNAV to negative. That'll create a Ponzi-like environment when they can't fund, they can't get that next sucker to buy the preferred because there's no income, or it will never be a Ponzi scheme if they find a way to actually turn this asset into an earning asset, which is why I keep coming back to that question.

So I think it's very clear that in no Ponzi scheme history has ever anyone ever said, "See, it's a Ponzi scheme." They suspect it might be a Ponzi scheme, but in the backward-looking history, first it has to fail and then let me tell you something, fraud will be the least of Saylor's problems. That slide will live in infamy, but it may never happen.

**Danny:** Andy, help me understand. Because let's say in the absolute worst case scenario, Bitcoin drops 90%. Michael has to pause dividends on the preferreds. Like what makes it a Ponzi scheme at that point? What makes it a Ponzi scheme? If the equity goes to zero, that would be one, by the way. But assuming that all he has to do is pause dividends, he doesn't have to sell any Bitcoin, then the likelihood of the equity going to zero is almost zero. Is that not right?

**Andy:** Well, I mean, unless he has fixed - so you can't bankrupt unless you have a fixed obligation. He does have some converts, but they're mostly small. That's not the downside case I'm worrying about, to be honest. I've never been worried about the downside case. I've been worried about he no longer has access to issuance at what he deems satisfactory levels of issuance and thus he can't pay the preferred shareholders. They experience a significant drawdown. The common shareholders experience a significant drawdown that takes MNAV below zero, below one. Remember, they always have the Bitcoin. That's why the term "adjacent," which I agree completely, is the essential one. There's the ETF, which is not a Ponzi scheme.

There is the preferred issuance which is creating dividend income necessary that requires further issuance. That's the Ponzi scheme bit. That's it. Only that bit. And when that can't work, when that issuance to pay dividends can't work, what the consequence to the various investor classes - that's hard to tell. But my basic assumption would be when they cannot finance any longer, they will either have to sell Bitcoin to pay their dividends or their MNAV will drop below one and their preferred shareholders will get washed out, meaning capital losses. Not they can hold them for as long as they want. But let me tell you something, a preferred that's never going to pay its dividend ever again trades very cheap, like practically zero.

**Danny:** At the start of this call, Andy, you were saying you used to work in capital structure arbitrage. Is that where if you saw these dividends get paused, then someone like you would step in and short the common stock?

**Andy:** Oh, if dividends get paused, the first thing that happens is the common stock goes down because there's an expectation that the common stock will be used to fund the dividends, or much more importantly, preferred are a small class of investors - much more importantly to fund debt payments. But yes, the first thing one does when a preferred dividend gets cut is short the stock.

**Danny:** Okay, Lyn, sorry I cut you off there.

**Lyn:** I was going to hop into largely agree with Andy with some caveats. And so for example, that's why on the earnings call I didn't just ask about Bitcoin falling. I specifically brought up the topic of capital access because you could have a stagnant sideways market. Bitcoin could fall 50% and just go sideways for three years, and then MNAV just compresses, and then it's like, "Well, what happens there?" and you start to run into challenges.

Now in the prior cycle, they primarily relied on converts, which gave them the advantage that on a quarterly basis they had very little obligation because they were either zero or near zero coupon. And the view was as long as Bitcoin doesn't go like five years in a bear market, they're probably not going to have an issue converting or refinancing these.

Now preferreds are interesting because it's more of a "bend and not break" model, which is they have higher quarterly obligations, but those obligations are less immediately catastrophic should they fail to meet those obligations. And now what that opens up to - and this is where I agree with Andy - the failure mechanism is then pretty well known, which is that if MNAV compresses, regardless of what Bitcoin price action is doing, if it just compresses, and obviously the deeper the bear market in Bitcoin, the worse this whole thing gets compared to your dollar-denominated liabilities, you start shutting off dividends.

There's one preferred where you don't even get back dividends - their junior ones. The senior ones where you do get paid back dividends, it's still based on the assumption that eventually Bitcoin and MNAV will both recover and the company will be able to issue more equity to back-fund those dividends.

The longer that doesn't happen, equity investors should start pricing in a negative MNAV or below one MNAV, I should say, because they say, "Well, okay, here's how much Bitcoin they have, here's how much debt they have, but then also they have this accumulating liability for preferreds once any of this comes back online, if it does." And so they can start pricing that in, and if you dig yourself in deep enough of a hole, the probability that they're going to recover diminishes, and people can bet on the probabilities and they will be.

So the point is I would consider a failure mode to be that if the company doesn't necessarily liquidate, but they have permanently impaired the preferred holders and the common equity holders, that would be a failure mode.

**Andy:** That 100% agree with every word Lyn just said. It can happen with Bitcoin at any price.

**Lyn:** Yeah. And so that's as an analyst, that's something I focus on, and that's why I brought it up on the earnings call. People are generally - we're in a bull market, but I like, "Let's ask the bear market question."

And I agree with you. I think that the main thesis here, the main question - and this is why I'm also pretty conservative on MNAVs and I'm willing to pay for treasury companies given any individual context - is they have a mechanism to effectively short fiat and get more Bitcoin. The fair MNAV is debatable. There's market participants actively debating on what that answer is. And the higher the market assigns it, the more Bitcoin yield these companies can get.

Now I expect that over the long arc of time, MNAVs will compress close to one when these become - and if they become a trillion dollar company, it just compresses very significantly, I think, over the long arc of time in a cyclical sense. So in a bull market it's high, in a bear market it's - I mean, MicroStrategy's already gone down to a very low MNAV in the prior bear market. So I think we can see one and then also see high again, but I think the cycles will compress closer to one.

Then the question is: is that two years from now, is that five years from now, is that 10 years from now, is that 15 or 20 years from now? And how much Bitcoin yield will they have accumulated by that time? And what will the capital structure look like when that starts to occur in a more persistent sense? Not again, not in like a one-year bear market or two-year bear market scenario that they might be prepared for, but just longer term when the MNAV is kind of permanently drained.

Now a lot of people thought that when the ETFs came out, that would permanently drain their MNAV, and this whole discussion around euphoria and high MNAVs occurred after that, ironically. So the market has shown an inability to determine when their MNAV is going to kind of persistently go away. And so we'll see, and that's the answer is I don't know, but that's why I prefer to be conservative with where I'm willing to enter with an MNAV, where I'm willing to trim my existing holdings if I perceive the MNAV is getting too high.

## Chances of Failure

**Danny:** Okay, that makes sense. So maybe just to close out on this section because I do want to talk to you about stablecoins as well because I think you've got an interesting take on those, Andy. But before we close out the treasury companies and MicroStrategy in particular, if you had to put kind of a percentage chance on them failing in the next decade, where would you put that? Because I mean, personally for me, it would seem like low single figures.

**Andy:** Bitcoin - sorry, MicroStrategy - failing in the way Lyn described, a washdown, a significant markdown in the preferred shares and an MNAV below one in the next 10 years, I think it's 50%. Wow.

**Danny:** Lyn, where would you put that?

**Lyn:** I think in the next 10 years there's a pretty high chance we enter that state in a bear market. Then the question is: do we get out of that state? I expect that we would. So I think in the next 10 years I would assign certainly a sub-50% chance that that's the ended discussion of where MicroStrategy ends up. But much like they were in the 2022 bear market, I think there's a chance that we'll find them somewhat impaired at some point in 10 years. I could be wrong. I think there's a decent chance. The idea that it happens permanently, I would assign probably less than a quarter.

**Andy:** Yeah, I don't know about permanently. I mean, guys can survive 2000. So can he survive another one? I guess. I don't think so. I don't think he'd come out of that spiral because things tend to be like that. You have these manias. Not to say that MicroStrategy is a mania and certainly not to say Bitcoin is a mania, but you had these strategies where a certain type of strategy works for a while, then it never comes back. SPACs are like that, but hey, SPACs are coming back, too. So maybe it's possible.
