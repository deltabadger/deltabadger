# BANKLESS: Ethereum's Next Decade | Vitalik Buterin (part 1)

Ryan and David unpack their conversation with Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum's next decade.

**Bankless Hosts:** So what are your hopes and dreams and goals for Ethereum to accomplish over the next 10 years?

**Vitalik:** A future of computing where a trustless vision of security that is based on cryptography and verification of code. The era of "trust me" for security starts looking as archaic as the era of not cleaning our water looks to us today. We've already gotten there with HTTPS. I think we need to get there with everything else. And I think Ethereum can be a huge part of making that happen.

**Bankless Hosts:** Ethereum just turned 10 years old and we have back on the podcast Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik, welcome back to Bankless. 

**Vitalik:** Thank you so much David and Ryan. It's great to be back. 

**Bankless Hosts:** So first happy birthday Ethereum.

## Ethereum's First 2 Years

**Bankless Hosts:** The Ethereum white paper was published all the way back in 2013. And then the Ethereum mainnet launched in July 2015. So 10 years later, Vitalik, how has Ethereum turned out compared to what you envisioned?

**Vitalik:** I mean, definitely far bigger than I was expecting. I think that's the most important thing. Also, you know, it's definitely taken longer than expected. It's definitely turned out to be more complex than I expected. I think when I wrote the November white paper, my plan was still that this would be a side project that I would quickly get done over a couple of months and then go back to university. And of course that ended up not happening. And then at some point we thought that you know we'd have four stages, we get to proof of stake and then exactly at that time the foundation would run out of money and then the project would just kind of sit on its own from there. That also didn't happen. Then you know of course all of the DeFi started happening and the various different waves of people launching different kinds of tokens started happening and a lot of that was written in the white paper. You know we had derivatives in the white paper as a use case and that actually exists, though of course the words that people ended up using are often different in a couple of cases. ENS happened, stable coins happened, but at the same time, lots and lots of really fascinating surprises.

**Bankless Hosts:** Mhm. Now that we have just 10 years of Ethereum in our rear view mirror,

## Ethereum's Top Contributions

**Bankless Hosts:** There's a lot that more or less went according to plan. I think if you read the white paper and then you look at what Ethereum is, you're like, "Yeah, that actually kind of followed suit with what some of the original visions were for Ethereum." Looking back, what has Ethereum uniquely contributed to the world that perhaps you are most proud of or most happy about?

**Vitalik:** You know, I think it has contributed to openness and decentralization just being a norm and a default mindset for a lot of people in a way that I think needs to be refreshed every generation. Right? So you know what traditional free and open source software was in the 1980s and 1990s, I think the blockchain world is in large part meant to be basically that but for the 2010s and 2020s. And I think for a lot of people it has actually done that. It's contributed to making a lot of things possible. Prediction markets are one of those examples. You know back in the early 2010s they were mostly an idea and I think Ethereum was the big experimental ground that really took them from idea to reality. 

The whole concept of DAOs, of course lots of ups and downs in that space, but just generally taking governance of organizations and structures that control resources and turning that into something that's much more hackable. I think very proud of that and I think we're going to keep on seeing dividends from that over the decades. So a lot of different things.

**Bankless Hosts:** Vitalik, you mentioned some surprises along the way. I can imagine there have been a number of surprises. One of

## Biggest Surprises

**Bankless Hosts:** which, which is kind of fascinating trivia, is you expected this to be a side project and it's turned into a, you know, a 10-year more or less full-time engagement and pretty massive in terms of scale. What were some of the big surprises though along the way with Ethereum, things you didn't expect?

**Vitalik:** The DAO getting such a huge amount of ETH and then of course breaking almost immediately. I mean I think in retrospect the first was a bit more surprising than the second. But still, that was a runaway use case. It was sort of an early DeFi use case in a way because it was all about capital formation and suddenly—I don't recall exactly but suddenly it was like 5% of all ETH supply or something incredibly massive. It went all the way up to 11% of supply, which I'm trying to remember. Or was it 11% of all ETH or was it 11 million ETH? Because if it was the latter then it would be like 17%. But it was crazy high. It was the first instance of animal spirits kind of really rearing its head on Ethereum.

**Bankless Hosts:** Okay, so that. What else along the way?

**Vitalik:** I mean, of course, ETC. That was the hard fork war. And then I love how it was almost like a TV series where just as the ETC chapter was winding down, at that exact time, the Shanghai DoS attack chapter began. You know, the writers put that in at exactly the right time. Maybe it was the same writer, I don't know. But that was such a fascinating series of technical challenges. 

NFTs were a big one. I was not really expecting anything like NFTs at all. I mean definitely just the scale to which DeFi grew once it actually started—going from just Uniswap barely existing in 2019 to the really big boom that we had even only a year and a half later. 

And other things: proof of stake taking much longer than I expected, of course. ZK happening like five times faster than I expected. That was good. The sheer level of institutional and then even government interest that came almost from the beginning. Even in the 2010s there were lots of big companies that were floating around that were really interested in the space. A lot of governments were interested. But I think a lot of that early interest was very abstract and I think just people trying to either be innovative or show that they could be innovative. But you know even still it was not something that I expected, and then now of course we're seeing the institutional interest come back but in this much more concrete form.

**Bankless Hosts:** Other things. One of the meta things you mentioned, Vitalik, is that all of this took

## What Took Longer than Expected

**Bankless Hosts:** longer than you thought it would, at least when you published the white paper. Why did it take longer? And when you say "take longer," are you talking about it taking longer to get to proof of stake in the first place, to sort of implement the rollup roadmap? What specific pieces took longer than you originally thought and why?
**Vitalik:** Part of it I think is just software being hard in a way that I did not have the experience to appreciate. Part of it was also I think us just setting higher and higher standards for ourselves, right? like the version of Ethereum that
we wanted to get out in a few months was actually what we would today call a layer 2 on top of Primecoin. And then of course what happened was that we saw the amount of attention and interest that we got in January and we realized like this is something a lot of people were putting their hopes into. this deserves a much more serious job.
And so we decided like, hey, we would actually make a proper L1. And I mean, of course, you know, at the time L1's where that like where it really made sense to build L2s on top of them were not really something that existed. What else? Uh yeah, I think it's probably a combination of those two things. Just like technology taking longer than expected and us just like continually raising our own standards.
**Bankless Hosts:** Mhm. In Ethereum's history, you talked about some of them. There have just been some of these huge challenges that were just totally unpredictable. The DAO fork being the first one, the Shanghai attacks. But even in times of Ethereum success, like the NFT mania in 2021, there were also challenges to the Ethereum project. And you know, the Ethereum project has just been faced with it's just a series of challenges over and over and over again. And I want you to comment on how Ethereum specifically, how that strategy has emerged as a culture, as a community, as people inside the Ethereum foundation, people in Ethereum core devs in the Ethereum community, we've developed responses, strategies, we have a particular strategy to overcoming challenges that is unique to Ethereum. And now that we have like kind of 10 years of data, how would you articulate what Ethereum's unique strategy is for overcoming challenges that are inherently unpredictable?

**Vitalik:** And I think we do a really good job of approaching the problem as an ecosystem. Like there's always a lot of different approaches that get tried at the same time. There's generally an L1 based approach. There's some kind of application layer approach. Often there's multiple competing approaches in each category and like we I think actually are able to pursue a lot of tracks in parallel. We're able to even get a lot of synergies between different tracks particularly in the way that like a whole bunch of different efforts in the space simultaneously contributed to making ZK Snarks more mature that all helped each other. Yeah, I think the style of collaboration that the ecosystem has developed has been proven really fascinating and I think it's definitely not been perfect but taken all together it's worked quite well.

## Lesson for Younger Vitalik

**Bankless Hosts:** If you could go back in time to a younger version of Vitalik or a younger version of the Ethereum Foundation and teach them something that would help them in Ethereum's journey, when would you go back and what would you teach?

**Vitalik:** I mean, one answer that comes to mind is of course all the way back to the beginning and just everything we know about ZK-SNARKs. That just has been such a powerful, game-changing technology in so many ways. Just for the sake of leapfrogging Ethereum ZK technology 10 years.

**Bankless Hosts:** Yeah, exactly.

**Vitalik:** Like I think there have been a lot of these technical wrong steps or side roads that we've taken that we did not actually really need to take. And had we just known what the end state actually looked like, then there were situations where we would have saved a lot of resources and in a lot of cases come to things much more quickly. So yeah, not being able to predict the future is definitely one of those annoying downsides of Ethereum.

Yeah, it's interesting because people do ask me what time capsule message would I have sent to myself, and a lot of the time the answer just is—give myself the correct answers technically. But then I wonder what other answers there even could have been other than just a big warning to be more realistic in terms of expecting timelines.

Sometimes I think to myself—might there have been ideas on the social side or economic side that in retrospect could have made things quite a bit better? So one of those examples potentially is: should Ethereum have had a time-limited portion of the supply given to public goods based on some crappy mechanism that we knew about back in 2014? And the argument there would basically be that we could have potentially been able to have no explicit premine but then have something like miners voting based on flags in the past 24 blocks on who gets the developer awards. And it possibly would have led to very similar results or potentially even more funding for both the foundation and other organizations, but it could have bought us more credibility in the earlier days.

One of the things I think about is also—could things have been done better in terms of the early relationship with Bitcoin? I think it's kind of always a bit sad that Ethereum was not able to capture more Bitcoin momentum. Here's one of the crazier hypotheticals: if for example Ethereum had done the issuance based on the formula that I said, and then let's imagine if it actually had been a fork of Bitcoin and then on top it just said basically "hey we are switching to proof of stake, we're going to start with some crappier proof of stake on day one but then we'll basically issue the entire remaining 4 million ETH based off of some developer formula." Potentially Ethereum could have just been the Bitcoin big blocker camp.
And I mean I think—I imagine you guys have probably read the reviews I've had of the big and small blocker sides of the block size war. And I wonder if basically, if Ethereum had just been the Bitcoin blockchain the whole time, there probably would have still been a fork. But the whole thing could have potentially proceeded much more productively. So that's one of those things that I sometimes think about, but it's easy—there's unintended consequences and surprises in all directions, right? It's possible that if you drag an existing community with you, you have lots of stakeholders from day one and then there's just a lot of things that you end up not being able to execute well on. So I don't know.

I mean it's always struck me that the Bitcoin kind of religion or philosophy has somewhat evolved into monotheism. And so I wonder if any kind of split coin would have always been destined to divide that community and splinter them in some way.

## Bitcoin vs Ethereum

**Bankless Hosts:** But we're 10 years in now, right? And Bitcoin is what—16 something like that? 

**Vitalik:** Yeah. 15. Well, 16. Yeah.

**Bankless Hosts:** Okay. So we're all kind of grown up together, I guess. Ethereum's entering its teenage years and I guess Bitcoin has just learned how to drive, something like that. Do you feel like the relationship is improved between Bitcoin and Ethereum, or is that just the ratio? I feel like Bitcoiners are always nicer to Ethereum folks when ETH is suffering on the Bitcoin ratio. So they're kind of quiet now. But when price direction changes, maybe things will change. But I feel like there's less hostility maybe between the newer cohorts of Bitcoiners and Ethereum. How would you characterize the relationship?

**Vitalik:** It depends what you mean by the new cohorts, right? Because I think there are different types of new cohorts. There's the people who are trying to be technical and trying to do BitVM and Taproot and Cascade and all of that stuff. And then there's the Saylors, and I don't really expect the Saylorists to ever be particularly friendly or to have any especially aligned values with Ethereum. 

On the technical side, I mean the smart ones have a lot of respect for the things that Ethereum is doing in terms of both the technical progress that it's made and increasingly the way the ecosystem is standing up for privacy. I think both more and more openly and more and more in a way where we're not just bringing vibes, we're actually bringing results. And at the same time I think a lot of people respect how people in Bitcoin actually are really trying with Cascade and some of these new Bitcoin layer 2 ideas and there is quite a bit of really fascinating technical work there. So I think it's definitely more positive in that way.

**Bankless Hosts:** When you see people building on Bitcoin in the technical way, like people building on the BitVM trying to make Bitcoin more expressive, do you ever think, "Man, you guys are just wasting your time? Just come build on Ethereum. That's what we built Ethereum for. That's what it's for." Or do you actually look at it with curiosity and optimism for what they can do there?

**Vitalik:** Some of both, I guess. 


## Ethereum's Cultural Evolution

**Bankless Hosts:** I want to ask about the current moment of time that Ethereum finds itself in. Um, re, you know, recently with the election of Donald Trump, we've seen a social trend shift both inside of crypto and outside of crypto.

**Ryan:** And maybe just to kind of name this social trend shift, I'll describe it as a "feminized WEF soy boy mentality" shifting to a "bronze age mindset," to quote someone on Twitter. Kind of like, you know, out with "woke," in with "based." This is the current zeitgeist of culture at this time. And we saw this in crypto, too, where many projects jostled to position themselves as USA-based projects. We had that infamous Solana marketing video about wanting to invent "technologies, not genders." And now we're seeing this still today in the cultural debate that's spawned out of Sydney Sweeney's jeans. Notably. Oh god, has that infected crypto yet, David?

**David:** Oh, I see it on my feed. It has now. Congrats, this episode is the memetic super-spreader event.

**Ryan:** Yeah, right. Exactly. So notably, Ethereum has not participated in this trend shift. By the way, I want to publicly thank Sydney Sweeney for not making any NFTs, hopefully. Or maybe we've also given her an idea, so watch out. So I want to ask about, whatever Ethereum was before this cultural trend shift, it still is today. And I want to ask, is that by design? Is Ethereum supposed to be this bulwark against the changing zeitgeist, the changing fads of the times?

**Vitalik:** I mean, Ethereum is I think supposed to be a pluralistic ecosystem that incorporates a lot of different people and a lot of different viewpoints, though at the same time especially in a world where there's many different cryptocurrencies and many different ecosystems, you are going to get different levels of drift or kind of self-selection happening organically. 

I mean, even if Ethereum was the only cryptocurrency, I think you'd expect to see differences in cultural valence between Ethereum and AI, for example, right? And I mean I think it's the duty of each project to just try to make the best and most upstanding version of the philosophy that its members are most enthusiastic about and comfortable with. And hopefully the result of all this is that we get things that are productive and that improve the world across a lot of different directions instead of just projects that fight each other or that basically get stuck in this mentality where all that they do is just shout vibes and then you just have one group shouting one vibe, another group shouting another vibe and they feel very righteous, but then you come back in 3 months and you realize they haven't actually made any progress.

And so I think personally—yeah there's definitely things that worry me about quite a lot about various cultural shifts that we've been seeing in the world. But then if you just worry then ultimately you're just one of the vibers. And so I think the practical question is: how do we actually advance and respond and actually create the next and better version of a competing alternative? And so I think in that regard, a couple of the new themes this year have been—

One of them is that I've tried to kind of say and do things to sort of reset the conversation on public goods funding in DAOs, right? Because I do think those are important topics and I do think that if you just give up on funding public goods, if you give up on basically any form of governance other than founder dictatorship, that still has a lot of quite negative consequences and the end state of that is that you just sort of get back to essentially "trust me" land. 

But at the same time, quadratic funding has actual problems. Token voting delegation DAOs have really big problems. And so I've been trying to be supportive of prediction market-based funding and prediction market-based DAOs. I've been working with Devanshu quite a bit—he's been doing Deep Funding, which is public goods funding, and there's a version two which is pretty directly based on prediction markets, basically combining together prediction markets with this jury mechanism. The idea is that if you have a gadget that can give a high-quality opinion of how valuable something is, but it takes a lot of effort, then you can use prediction markets as a way of scaling it.

But for the public goods funding domain, they'll create what political scientists call an "open access order," a game where anyone can come in and if they do a good job, they can succeed and feel like they have a fair chance. Something that doesn't devolve into a social game, something that doesn't devolve into being a game of convincing a few central actors, and then trying to actually push that into some actual experiments. So, Devine and the Golem team have been doing quite a bit of work there.

And then the other big thing that I've been like really trying to push is this greater focus on privacy, right? And I think, you know, the reason why is because first of all, privacy has been a core part of the cypherpunk spirit since the beginning. If you remember e-cash from 1982, e-cash was actually not decentralized. It had a central operator that all of the transactions went through, but it was private, and it was private from the central operator. Because those were the properties of the technology that we could actually do, and because of technological limitations, we flipped over and went to Bitcoin, which was decentralized but it was not private. But now, of course, we have ZK-SNARKs, those technological limitations are gone, and we actually can be decentralized and private, and so we actually should be.

And so there's been some really interesting work that's been starting to happen in terms of really standardizing Railway-style privacy pools, making it easier to incorporate privacy protocols, looking at the privacy of reading the chain. So basically, if you're an ordinary user and you have a browser wallet and you don't have two terabytes to spare, what is a way for you to access Ethereum without just revealing all of your data about everything you're doing to Infura? And so there's been some really fascinating cryptographic and academic work that's been happening there.

And I think, in terms of cultural triangulation, my role model there is Milei. Because if you look at what Milei did, I think it's actually kind of brilliant. He has bronze age vibes, but his substance is actually the same kind of stuff that I think all three of us support and would have supported at any time in the last 15 years. You know, he has made markets more free. He has made the government more efficient. He has really reduced inflation. He's simplified a lot of things in housing markets. He has done a lot. He's also reduced tariffs. He's made the country more open. His government even worked with us to make it easier for people to get visas for Devconnect. So actually, in a lot of ways, on the substance, he is very much not like that, but at the same time, he has the vibes of the other side and so he manages to appeal to a lot of people very successfully.

To me, privacy actually has a lot of those same properties because privacy is freedom. Privacy is a very important right that we're all here to protect. Privacy is something that has to be built technologically speaking. If you have privacy as a focus, then the game that you're playing is a game that's about doing, and it's not about talking. But at the same time, privacy is not multi-billion dollar grifting. Privacy is not people ripping off t-shirts and stomping their chests a lot. Privacy is not colluding with all politicians. And so it's one of those things that I think really everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem should be able to get behind, and so I think it's something that we just have to really keep pushing forward on.

## Privacy on Ethereum

**Bankless Hosts:** Well, let's talk about it some more, because I think that's an interesting cultural component of how we balance Ethereum values versus this mainstreaming moment with trad-fi to talk about privacy. So, I guess with Milei, you're saying he's sporting the "bronze age mullet," let's call it, where it's bronze age in the front, but it's good, sensible policy and getting things done in the back. It actually works.

And so, how do we "bronze age mullet" our way to privacy on Ethereum? I mean, it does seem like in some areas we've made tremendous progress on the cryptography side of things. We have ZK technology that's just incredible. But times where we've tried to implement privacy, like Tornado Cash, we've got the live court case going on. We don't know yet the verdict at the time of this recording of Roman Storm. And so anytime you get into financial privacy, you get nation-state pushback.

And there's an argument that I've always thought was somewhat valid: that if Ethereum or Bitcoin, for that matter, shipped privacy on Layer 1 from the very beginning and it was all private, we would have never gotten this far in terms of broad acceptance because there are forces out there that would have strangled this technology in its crib.

So how do we balance all of these things and get to a place where we're happy and content? And I guess, maybe nation-states that try to preserve some level of freedom also feel fine with letting this move forward. What's a realistic privacy roadmap here?

**Vitalik:** Yeah. So, I think there are two parts to that. One part is just, how do we get from privacy being very niche to privacy being a default part of the experience? And question two is, how do we make a critical mass of governments and regulators okay with that?

For question one, the reason why I have not supported literal on-chain Layer 1 privacy—like EIP-7503 and that kind of stuff—so far is not because I think it's fundamentally wrong, but because I think it's basically too early technologically to make that kind of commitment. What I mean by that is that, one, we don't yet know exactly which technologies will be optimal. If we put a technology in as Layer 1, then we could be locking ourselves into something very suboptimal. This is obviously a concern with any EIP that we make, but with privacy, because the data is inherently private, you can't just muck around and replace the tree and search-and-replace one thing with another if you really have to. It's harder to upgrade.

**Bankless Hosts:** Right. Vitalik, does this imply that you believe privacy on the Ethereum Layer 1 is fundamentally correct?

**Vitalik:** Um, I mean, I think in the long term, I'm very open to it. One argument is future compatibility, as I mentioned. The other argument is security. You have to remember that a privacy gadget on L1 breaking would be extremely bad because someone would be able to steal an unlimited number of coins undetectably.

I think eventually the tech will be good enough that we will be able to make that jump. I am serious when I said in my recent blog post that there is a trend line that the number of bugs in code actually is trending down to zero. So we will get to the point where we're going to be able to have very high levels of trust in code, to the point where security researchers who have been trained on the past 20 years will find it unimaginable. And I think AI will accelerate that.

But before that happens... and also, Zcash, to their credit, they've been brave and they've just gone ahead and done it. But even still, that's a high bar.

And so the question is, can we make privacy as default as possible without making it Layer 1? To me, the medium-term target is to make privacy default in wallets. The way that we do this is... basically, I think the biggest mistake that we're making as an ecosystem right now is that we came up with this concept of a "privacy wallet." We should not have privacy wallets. Privacy should be a feature of wallets.

**Bankless Hosts:** What are you talking about? So if I'm in my existing crypto wallet browser extension, let's say on mobile, there's an option like I can send a transaction normally or I could send a private transaction. That kind of default?

**Vitalik:** Exactly. Like you have a private balance and a private send button, and it's all part of MetaMask or Rabby or whatever.

**Bankless Hosts:** And can we do that now? And why don't we do that now?

**Vitalik:** Yeah, I mean there's actually some work that's starting inside the EF to try to move things in that kind of direction already. So hopefully, yes, some of that should come out over the next few months.

**Bankless Hosts:** What about the other part of that question, which is how can we get nation-states on board? Obviously, projects like Nation State Resistant Privacy Ethereum want to push the Overton window towards more privacy, more open-source, more decentralization. And so, to some extent, that will be anti- some governments, some cultures that don't embrace that. But we want to push the culture over, and we also want mainstream acceptance of this thing. We can't have it be illegal in all of the countries of the world. Is there some sort of balance we can strike to get some of the nation-state concerns around criminality and money laundering addressed, and also balance the cypherpunk values here? Or are these just incompatible?

**Vitalik:** Yeah. So I think, first of all, all of the progress that we've been making on the privacy pools concept over the past couple of years has been very good. Now, Railgun exists and you can use it, and there are successful cases where we can point to where it's actually prevented people who have hacked large-scale DeFi contracts from putting their funds into it. Privacy pools are doing very similar technology. So that whole concept is starting to be more battle-tested.

The thing to realize so far is that in terms of illicit funds that pass through privacy protocols, by far the largest portion of it is people stealing from DeFi protocols or, in some cases, stealing from individuals. In both of those cases, those are actually very amenable to this kind of privacy-protocol-level blacklisting. Because if your money gets stolen, then presumably there will be just an API where you can flag your own coins as being suspicious. And if a DeFi project gets hacked, then it'll do the same thing. So I think that already is something that can really push things forward quite a bit.

In terms of how much more we can or will need to do, I think the thing to keep in mind is that the fiat ecosystem is definitely not a paragon of bad-actor resistance. There are all kinds of bad actors that have all kinds of ways to move money around, to anonymize themselves, to avoid detection. The equivalent of seven proxies and all of these things... well, there are ways, and they know how to use them.

Given that funds are transparent on a public blockchain, at least in the sense of, you can point to transactions that are happening, and if something happens to your money, you know when it's getting moved... I actually think that getting to a level of bad-actor resistance that approaches the fiat ecosystem, but at the same time giving people much more actual privacy, is probably quite doable.

So to me, that's one prong. And I think the second prong is that we do just need to make the positive case for why greater levels of privacy are important, including from the perspective of law enforcement-type objectives. For me, the motivating example of this is that there's been a couple of these cases... it actually happens all the time now. Most recently, there was telecom wiretap data, the type of data that telecoms are required to collect and give to the government under the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. A bunch of that got hacked, and I believe the evidence is leaning that it got hacked by China or some China-affiliated actor. But actually, I have no idea; all of these things are probabilistic.

This is just one example, and this happens in all kinds of directions among all pairs of nation-states quite a lot recently. And so a world where you have this kind of centralized data collection running rampant is a world of fragility because if those databases get hacked, then data that you think might be contributing to national security will actually end up contributing to national insecurity. I think that is a case that needs to be made much more strongly to lawmakers and to the public in general: that aggressively minimizing data collection is actually the safe thing to do, and this is the thing that we should be moving toward. And privacy-preserving finance is part of that.
