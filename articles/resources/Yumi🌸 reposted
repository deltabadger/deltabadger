The more you size up to win faster, the faster you guarantee ruin.
The path to big profits is paradoxical—you must size small enough to last long enough.

It's not about the outcome—it's about the process. Profits will follow in due course.
These phrases are not meant to console you after a losing trade.
Only those who remain steadfast—no matter what—earn the right to say them.

Waiting is like holding a camera still.
Without stillness, nothing comes into focus.

"But if I'm following the rules and still losing streaks happen, shouldn't I do something about it?"
Losing streaks are a natural, statistically embedded phenomenon.
Precisely because you feel that unnecessary sense of responsibility—"I have to fix this"—and start meddling.

Stop chasing new methods.
Stop abandoning systems after streaks.
Stop thinking consistency is optional.
Consistency is the work.
Consistency is the edge.
Consistency is the trader.

Consistency is not about repeating wins.
It is about repeating rules.
Every win and every loss generated by rules is part of the data.
Only when the data is consistent does probability reveal its edge.

No matter how strong a system with an edge you have, you still won't succeed.
Many people still don't succeed, no matter how good their system is.

Hesitation or fear at the point of entry is proof your thinking has turned short term.
Remember, you are not trading for the outcome of a single isolated result in front of you.
Your strategy reveals its true value only through repetition over the long run.

Stop trying to control the market.
Start controlling the only thing you can: your next click.

The only "perfect" trade is the one executed perfectly according to your rules.
Everything else is gambling.

Freedom in trading is not the freedom to choose.
It is the freedom from choice—rules decide everything.

Today's gains will inevitably be given back.
Trade on the premise that any profit you book will be given back.
The profit you truly earn lies far down the road, as the cumulative result of obeying your rules and taking wins and losses over and over.
