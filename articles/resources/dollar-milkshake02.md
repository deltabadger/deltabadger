hi everyone my name is Brent Johnson and
I've got a wealth management business in
San Francisco where I manage money for
high net worth individuals I've been
doing that for about 20 years through
Santiago capital I do some alternative
investment and advisory work and I'm
also part of a firm called Baker Avenue
Asset Management where traditional
assets are custody
and today I'm going to talk to you about
two of my favorite subjects with this
Dollar in gold
um now they're often seen as competitors
if not mortal enemies uh but in my
opinion before it's all said and done
they're they're going to rise together
but eventually there will only be one
left
uh now I don't want to speak for anybody
else but I typically find when somebody
has a strong opinion about either gold
or the dollar it's mainly because
they've come to the conclusion that the
Fiat money system is kind of out of
control they've printed all this money
they've borrowed all this debt it can't
be paid off so they're going to have to
print it until it all goes away so raise
your hand if you've heard this argument
before
okay so I tend to agree with that but
probably not in exactly the same way
that you think
because while I definitely think the
monetary system is going to come to an
end I think it's the dollar strength
which is going to kill it and not the
weakness
so why do I think that
well this is this graph of the dollar
going back to its all-time high in the
mid 80s and as you can see for the last
10 years it's kind of been rising in
this kind of descending wedge or
ascending wedge and I think we are now
at the stages early stages of what I
consider to be a perfect dollar storm
and what I mean by that is
um I don't think we could design a more
perfect short squeeze on the dollar if
we set out to do so and I think before
it's all said and done it's going to go
back to its all-time highs and the
knock-on effects I think will shock
everybody including those of us who are
actually waiting for it to happen
um now why do I think this is going to
happen why do I think it's going to go
back to its all-time highs
well mainly anybody who's ever heard me
speak before you know I never just come
up and just throw up a bunch of charts
and crafts so I'm going to use a couple
movies one called The Prestige which is
a movie about magic and revenge one
called There Will Be Blood which is a
movie about the Cutthroat Oil Business
and funnily enough milkshakes and then
finally Highlander which is a movie
about these Immortals who travel through
time having these epic battles along the
way
um now I'm going to read something from
the very beginning of the movie The
Prestige because I think it sets it up
very well and the magician's assistant
he says every great magic trick consists
of three parts or acts the first part's
called The Pledge the magician shows you
something ordinary a deck of cards a
bird or a man
the second act is called the turn the
magician takes something ordinary and
makes it do something extraordinary now
you're looking for the secret but you
won't find it because of course you're
not really looking you don't really want
to know but you still won't clap yet
because making something disappear isn't
enough you have to bring it back and
that's why every magic trick has a third
act called The Prestige
now just to show you that whether you
believe in magic or not it can be
effective tool I'm going to ask you to
do something for me on the next page I'm
going to give you an example and when I
go to the next slide I'm going to ask
you guys to pick a card is everybody
ready
okay so pick a card look at that one
card
stare at the card
Focus exclusively on that one card
memorize it because in three two one
I'm gonna make it disappear
did it work
Okay so
I use this movie because make no mistake
the central bankers and monetary
authorities are amongst the greatest
sleight of hand and Magic experts alive
today
after the global financial crisis they
started a magic trick of their own their
own their pledge was that everything was
okay we've got all these bad debts under
control
in the turn they actually did make them
disappear they hit all these bad debts
on the central bank balance sheets
now initially the most aggressive
magician was the Federal Reserve and
they printed enough money
to expand the monetary Base by 400
percent the idea was to not only make
the bad debts disappear but inflate away
the dollar so the still existing debts
were easier to pay off
and this is where a secondary trick was
also attempted by some non-us magicians
since the dollar was going to get
inflated away these non-us actors
borrowed an additional 11 trillion or
they doubled their exposure to U.S
dollar debt taking it up to about 11
trillion which is double in the last 10
years now keep this in mind because
we're going to come back to it after a
while
now many of this Us in this room
probably tried the same trick
we knew what the central banks were up
to we knew they were trying to inflate
away the dollar
so we bought gold any anticipation of it
being inflated away
I mean we got rid of our dollars and and
bought something you know a real asset
whether it was gold or silver or the
like
and this brings me to Highlander this is
the story about the Immortals who only
can be killed when their heads get cut
off
the kurgan on the left is the biggest
and the baddest of all the Immortals
let's think of him as the dollar
and Connor McLeod on the right he's our
hero he's more of a poet than a fighter
and he's not really interested in
fighting he just wants to be left alone
and now it becomes very clear early on
in the movie that these two are bound to
fight an epic battle but the thing is
there's many battles that come before
this one before The Ultimate Showdown
and in many prior battles it's the
kurgan who's running around the world
cutting off other people's heads and the
way it works is when you cut off another
immortal's head all their power flows
back to you so by the time of the epic
showdown the kurgan is bigger and
stronger than anybody else
and I really think that's what's going
on with the dollar right now everybody's
focused on the end game between dollars
and gold but in the meantime the dollar
is going to run around and cut every
other Fiat currency's head off
and all that capital and all that go or
all that power is going to flow back
into the dollar
so what about the dollar demand
everybody tells me that you know there's
this d-dollarization effort going on and
the Dollar's losing demand well that's
not actually true
there's a lot of demand for the dollar
for many different sources and even if
we and uh you know whether it's the
interest to pay the existing debt the
interest to pay the non-us debt um the
global funding currency of the world or
the demand for new debt from the U.S
treasury
so if we just look at the demand for
Debt Service alone if you look at the
dollar debt in the world and you just
consider the debt service for that
dollar debt there's about 40 trillion of
dollar debt
and if that was all issued at 2.3
percent which is the average rate on the
outstanding U.S treasury you're talking
about 850 billion dollars a year just to
service the dollar-based debt forget
about repayments forget about any trade
just to service the dollar debt so
that's an incredible amount of dollar
demand just to service the existing debt
[Music]
not only that but despite all his flaws
the US dollar is still Far and Away the
biggest funding currency in the world
almost everyone all over the world uses
it to some extent and because they've
used it for funding they can't walk away
from it until they've paid off that debt
treasury issuance is often cited as a
reason for the dollar to get weak the
dog the U.S is borrowing more money they
can never pay it off they're going to
have to inflate it away and in the long
term this is true but in the short term
this is demand for dollars the treasury
is going out to a pool of dollars and
buying that from the market that's an
incredible amount of demand
the next argument is that China Russia
and all these others will no longer buy
our Sovereign bonds because they don't
want to fund us anymore and that's true
they are decreasing their purchases but
this isn't new this has been a declining
trend for several years and most of our
budget is now financed from internal
sources anyway and if they were happy to
buy our debt at one and a half percent
they probably love it at two and a half
or three
okay so that helps explain demand a
little bit but what about Supply can't
Supply just be expanded
well it can but this is where we get
back to the prestige now many tricks
take more than one person to perform and
in this movie
when uh the the coordination failed
um somebody died and now it led to a
bunch of Revenge
and then in the real world here we have
two magicians who are no longer
coordinating with the rest of the world
and each of them in their own way is
making dollars disappear faster than you
can say it
trumps make it a great again policies
are starving the rest of the world of
its most important export and that is
U.S dollars if trade doesn't take place
or if fewer trade takes place fewer
dollars circulate and Supply becomes
harder to get
and this guy not only is he not printing
dollars anymore he's actually raising
rates sucking dollars in from around the
world and make it even harder for the
competitors to compete with it
so what are other methods that lead to
the Dollar's continued use
well now let's talk about There Will Be
Blood now in this movie Daniel Plainview
was an oil man and as ruthless as they
come and he used every trick and Tool
available to take Supply away from his
competitors
and just like there are pipes tubes and
hoses for the oil business there's pipe
tubes and hoses for the current monetary
system and it's through these existing
pipes tubes and hoses that Capital flows
these pipes tubes and hoses are
controlled by the United States
specifically the treasury the Federal
Reserve and the chips and Swift systems
and in the same way that they can let
other countries use this system they can
also kick them out
and if you don't think that kicking them
out is a big deal just check out the
economies of turkey Iran North Korea and
to some extent Russia
now over the years there's been many
potential Alternatives who've tried to
be or have been believed to be The Heir
Apparent to the global Reserve but the
reality is is they're all just
Pretenders they don't even compare to
the US dollar
now don't get me wrong de-dollarization
trend is real it is happening countries
are fed up with the US dollar they hate
that the U.S uses it as a weapon and
they would very much like to
de-dollarize and there's always been
Black Market of ways to get around the
official system
but these black market Alternatives and
these special purpose vehicles that are
talked about are the basic equivalent of
uh
of hooking a garden hose up to a system
like this that's currently existing and
if these if these uh you know if these
special purpose vehicles in these size
channels are such a great system
then why do the competing currencies
look like this
why do their competing currencies
continue to fall against the dollar
the bottom line is is that forget even
if you don't if you could get everybody
else in the room and the rest of the
world to agree to lose leave the dollar
and you could then agree which currency
you're going to use and then you could
then agree which country is going to
enforce it the current another system
does not exist there is no distribution
channel for all the other currencies in
the world the same way that there is for
the dollar
okay so what about future QE can't today
just turn back on the printing presses
and then played away the dollar
well to understand that these diverse
have to understand that there's
currently no intention to do that most
economic indicators are currently better
now than they were when they first
started their rate hikes
and second reason is that it's not going
to happen anytime soon for one very
simple reason the U.S is no longer
injecting money into the system they've
swapped out their syringe for a straw
and they're now using a straw that sucks
up liquidity rather than a syringe to
inject it like all our competitors
and that the FED is now enabling the U.S
to drink the milkshake the dollar
milkshake and the currency milkshake
that all the other countries out there
are still printing
and this is probably the most famous
scene from the movie There Will Be Blood
when Daniel explains to Eli who has oil
on his land that all Daniel has to do is
insert a straw from his side of the
fence and he's going to drink Eli's
milkshake
the US is currently doing the rest of
the world is still injecting QE or
running massive budget surpluses which
we are as well but we have the straw by
a higher interest rates and we're
sucking up all their stimulus you can
already see this happening
and this is why the dollar has been
getting stronger over the last 12 months
and I think it's going to get even more
so
um and now remember that pledge that we
talked about back in 2008 as well as the
side trick where the international
entities borrowed in dollars
well now it's coming time for the third
step or The Prestige
we all know it's time or sorry let's
look at two of the top three magicians
that almost doubled their dollar
exposure dollar debt exposure since
2008. turkey and Argentina
this is Turkey's Lira from last year it
dropped almost 50 percent
their stock market dropped at 45 percent
what about Argentina they did the same
thing
well their their peso was down 50 as was
their stock market
this is basically the dollar kurgan
running around the world and chopping
off other Fiat currencies heads and
these are just two examples there's many
many more
because the dollar repayment system or I
mean the maturity wall for emerging
market debt is hitting now and it's
hitting big they don't have another two
or three years to prepare this is 200
billion dollars of debt that has to be
repaid by emerging markets in the next
24 months and I know we're so used to
hearing about trillion dollar deficits
here in the U.S and and some other lower
Western countries but 200 billion
dollars for emerging markets is an
incredible amount of money especially
when their economies are already hurting
and the supply of dollars is falling
now the Fantastic Prestige that these
magicians were planning has failed
miserably rather than paying off a
depreciated dollar they have to pay off
an appreciated dollar and there are not
enough dollars to go around in other
words there's no rabbit to be pulled out
of the Hat
the international Enterprise the
international entity prestigious failing
because there's no place else for
Capital to go my my friend Keith said
for the US dollar to crash it means an
enormous amount of funds have to leave
the dollar and go somewhere else where
do they go
are they going to go to Europe well this
is a chart of the German stock market
the most stable and most important
economy in Europe and let me tell you
that is one ugly chart anybody want to
buy that chart
what about not only that but they have
huge political problems both Mario
draghi and Merkel are on their way out
they've got huge Independence movements
happening in Italy Spain and Greece I
mean it's not going to be long before
junker is all alone and drinking by
himself
so where else is it going to go or is
the money going to flow into
International bonds well there's about
eight trillion dollars worth of negative
yielding bonds how many people here want
to buy a negative yielding Bond whether
you have to pay the country to hold on
to the bond for you anybody show of
hands
yeah anybody hold dollars who owns the
dollars
okay a few people more people own
dollars than they do International bonds
okay
what about International stocks now this
is a graph of all the the equity indices
around the world now granted the US was
down six percent nobody wants to be down
six percent but compared to everybody
else who were down double digits where
would you rather own would you rather
own Coca-Cola or do you want to own an
Emerging Market stock I don't know
anybody buying Emerging Markets right
now
okay
so that brings us back to the epic
showdown of dollar and gold and here's
the thing we're just not ready for the
end of the movie yet the dollar kirgan
still has more heads to chop off
now people will tell me all the time or
sorry let me go back one
now people tell me all the time that
gold can provide a very elegant solution
to the dedolarization problem and of
course this is true this is why I've
been pounding the table that everybody
should own gold of course it will work
of course it will save the few people
who own it when the time comes but
regardless of the fact the rest of the
world doesn't yet believe it especially
the people in the west and even if they
do the governments of the world hate it
they've been working for 50 years to get
it out of the system they will fight its
reintroduction with every fiber of their
being
and then they'll also often tell me that
the the ratio of physical gold available
to the number of calls on it on the
comics is way out of whack over 200 to
one and of course again this is true but
what people forget is that the same
thing exists in dollars there's only
four three and a half to four trillion
dollars of a U.S monetary base but
there's at least 70 trillion claims on
it so the the leverage ratio that all
people often quote in Gold actually also
exist in dollars
I'm going to skip forward a little bit
now this is another chart that people
will often throw up to tell you to say
why you should own gold and again I
really believe in this chart this is a
great reason to own gold but it
basically shows about the the least
liquid instruments how they flow down in
some kind of a crisis down to the most
liquid instrument and the highest
powered money at the very bottom which
is gold
but you can't use this chart to be
bullish gold and not also be bullish the
dollar because right above gold sits the
dollar and when everything Cascades down
it Cascades through the dollar before it
goes to gold
basically what I'm saying is as the
money flows into the United States from
around the world the rest of the world
is going to get the deflation and these
deflationary pressures are going to put
even more pressure on them
and we are going to get the inflationary
pressures from the flows of capital
it's basically a short squeeze and I
think what's going to happen is there is
going to be less liquidity in the world
and it's going to get squeezed and a
while will lead to even less liquidity
the little liquidity that there is is
going to be traveling faster and it's
going to flow to the path of least
resistance and the path of least
resistance is the United States
now first of all or finally I should say
I don't necessarily want this to happen
I don't necessarily think this is just I
don't necessarily think we deserve it
but it's not my job to sit up here and
tell you what I want to happen it's my
job to come up here analyze the world
and figure out what is going to happen
and this is what I think is going to
happen
I think all the capital is going to flow
back into the United States in this
short squeeze
I think it's going to push the dollar
back to its all-time high
I think Euro yields are going to come
under extreme pressure I think European
yields could easily double
they're really low now they're lower
than the U.S treasury if the U.S
treasury is the risk-free rate why in
the hell are these countries yielding
rest less than the risk-free rate it
doesn't make any sense
here's uh the Euro I think the euro is
going to go back to par with the dollar
and eventually go much lower
this is uh I think both Hong Kong and
China going to recession and I think the
peg on both of them break and when the
peg on Hong Kong dollar and the the
Chinese Yuan break that's going to be
really bad for copper so I think copper
goes a lot lower
this is the Australian dollar as if
Australia did not have enough troubles
the way it was with their huge real
estate bubble that is in the process of
crashing when China goes down
Australia is going to go down hard I
think the Australian dollar will fall 30
or 40 from here
and I don't have quite a
quietness I think oil is going to come
under pressure as well if you want to
learn about to oil I met a guy named art
Berman yesterday which I highly
recommend you look him up because he has
as much knowledge on the oil industry as
anybody I've ever talked to
gold is trying to get a definitively
break out of this long-term Trend or
wedge that's been into and it might you
know it's hit this level several times
over the last couple years and every
time it hits it it goes down I think
with the dollar getting a lot stronger
in the short term I think gold goes
lower I'm not telling you to go and sell
your gold everybody should own gold as
an insurance policy against the
craziness of the political financial and
social Madness that's probably coming
but it doesn't mean that the insurance
policy is going to pay off right away so
I've met a lot of people who are certain
that the gold is going to go higher and
I'm certain it is too but the problem is
is many of these people have put 60 70
80 percent of their net worth into gold
and they don't have any liquidity from
anywhere else to live
and if you're if you don't want to be
selling gold at a thousand dollars to
function your life you need to feel you
need to put some on the sideline right
now
here's the probably the most
controversial part of my theory is that
I think the capital flows will actually
push the U.S stock market higher I think
we're in a correction right now and the
correction might go back and retest the
lows we saw a month ago but ultimately I
think U.S stocks are going much higher
before this is all said and done I think
we're going to have a massive blow off
top I think we're going to go to
all-time highs because I think U.S
stocks will be seen as a refuge from the
storm when Europe Asia Australia South
America and all the other Emerging
Markets come under pressure
and then the dollar as the dollar goes
back to its all-time highs the the world
financial system just cannot survive on
a strong dollar it just doesn't function
so something is going to have to be done
and whether it's an overnight
revaluation another coordinated plasma
chord type thing it's going to have to
be revalued and when the when the dollar
starts going down and when they start
doing things to weaken it that's when
the U.S assets will lose value that's
when the stock market will crash that's
when Gold's really going to shine
because the final showdown that
everybody's waiting for is definitely
going to happen
and it's just like in Highlanders there
can only be one at the end of the day
gold will beat the dollar it's the one
asset that can't be inflated away it's
the one asset that can't be destroyed in
a deflationary collapse so everybody
should own gold but it doesn't mean it's
going to happen tomorrow
thanks for listening
