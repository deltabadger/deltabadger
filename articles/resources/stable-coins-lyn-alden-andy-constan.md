## Stablecoins & Global Dollar Demand

**Guests:** Lyn Alden, Andy Constan

**Andy:** Yeah. Why don't you kick us off, Andy, because I've spoken to Lyn about this in the past a number of times and we were messaging before we did this show. And I think you've got a really interesting take. So you start us off with what you think stablecoins are, what kind of addressable market there is for them, right?

**Andy:** So I want to be very limited because mostly I don't know. I want to be limited to one kind of stablecoin that I'm not even sure actually exists at this very moment, which is a GENIUS Act compliant, fully backed stablecoin. The reason why I want to keep that in the frame is because they can only own - for one, they are illegal. It's illegal for them to pay interest. And two, they can only own what I consider money, meaning treasury bills, bank reserves and repo, and government-backed versions of those things. And so let's start with that.

Then the way I break it down is there's three things I care about, which is - and again, I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out the world.

One is what I think people call payment rails, which are how we in our lives, both domestically and cross-border - most of us spend our lives within borders - buy and sell stuff. Credit cards are the front of a bank account. Stripe and PayPal are the front of a credit card. Checking accounts are literally bank accounts. ACH, bank wires, all of these things are ways in which we move deposits from our bank to somebody else's deposits. And those are what - and I guess Venmo and Zelle are more platforms than they are - they do some of those things. It's a transfer of deposits from one person to another.

And so I think in the US by and large, I think it works pretty well. I don't hear a lot of complaints about the timing or speed or cost of transacting between bank accounts. Wires are anachronistic and are really the only way to do large transactions, and those are too damn expensive. So maybe there's something there. But pretty much all those other things work just fine. Could there be a better solution like stablecoins? Yes, if it eliminates the entire bank checking account part of the world. So that's one thing.

The next thing is: okay, in that world where you have people transacting, employers paying people in a stablecoin, employed getting stablecoin and then using it to transact for their daily usage. Let's say that world exists. What is the balance of money that will be held in stablecoin just for transactions? Because I think we all probably keep a little bit of money in our checking account just because, even though it pays absolutely zero interest. So that's another thing.

And then the third thing is stablecoins as a long-term vehicle for saving US dollars. And that's my framework. And so when I think about all those things, I say I don't know, but it sounds like there is a very good use case, particularly outside of the US, for a new payment rail in US dollars. Two, if there is a new payment rail, there's going to be a little bit of money that people keep on their phone instead of keeping in their checking account on their phone. They'll keep it in stablecoins on their phone, and that'll pay no interest and create excess demand for T-bills. And then lastly, as a savings vehicle, I don't get it. I mean, as a savings vehicle within the US, I totally agree. It's the rest of the world where that becomes more interesting. But Lyn, I'll let you respond to that.

**Lyn:** So I mean, Andy and I are pretty aligned, I think, on stablecoins. I might be one or two degrees shifted a little bit more toward maybe the bull camp of them. I've been on record since 2021 that I think Bitcoin - stablecoin market cap is going to grow dramatically. It has. I still think it's going to grow dramatically. But I generally agree that a lot of the percentage of it won't be fully new demand for dollars and T-bills. It'll come out of existing usage of dollars.

And for example, even like the treasury secretary tweeted out the 3.7 trillion figure for new stablecoin and therefore like T-bills expectations from some report. If you actually dig into that report - so that was Citibank, Citigroup, one of their research divisions. Their analysis was by 2030 they had a base and bull case for what the world of stablecoins could look like. Their base case was 1.6 trillion in stablecoins. Their bull case was 3.7 - that was the one that the secretary was citing.

But if you look at either any of those cases, let's say the 1.6 one, their base case, they actually broke down where they expect that to come from, and some of it was from American like bank deposits, some of it was foreign already dollar-denominated bank deposits, some of it was from physical bank notes, some of it was from money markets. There are these various kind of just pools that could move into stablecoins, with only some of that being fresh new demand for people that hold Egyptian pounds and want dollars and find this - and that they might have not otherwise do it physically. I know people that actually do that. But let's say there's some people that because of the frictions involved don't do that, and stablecoins might make them easier, and you just apply that to any country you want to talk about that will create some new demand.

The other caveat is that it's not the same as a dollar - as Andy would agree, it's a payment mechanism as well. So for example, I know Egyptians that buy physical dollars purely as savings, not for like 10-year savings but like one-year savings. They'll for longer-term savings they like gold and real estate and things like that. So liquid intermediate-term savings - there's a pretty big market for that in developing countries. They can do that with physical dollars. Stablecoins in some capacities make it easier to get to them, which, and Andy pointed this out, can lower the gray market premiums for dollars that you find in many markets.

I would also argue it could create new demand for dollars because part of the demand side could be adjusted based on those frictions diminishing. They say, "Well, I used to have to pay this much for a dollar. I used to have to go some sketchy place and make these connections, and now I can just do it on my phone. So maybe now I actually want more dollars than I did before when my only option was physical or like a local bank I don't trust." So I think that can increase demand.

And then also I think one of the things that doesn't get discussed enough is small businesses around the world. So there are 40+ currencies in Africa. There are 30+ currencies in Latin America. Some dozens in Southeast Asia. I don't know the number off hand. And imagine if in the United States like every state had its own currency. So your customers have different currencies. Your people lending you money might have different currencies. You're trying to figure out how to save some of your currencies. You find that state X has better currency than state Y and you're in Y but you want to hold state X currency for your liquid savings. So it can be a mess. That's the case in a lot of the world.

And so I think there's a business case where a lot of these businesses will want to hold some stablecoin balance that's pretty substantial that bank notes are not solving for them, that local banks are not solving for them. And so I think there's a stablecoin demand for that.

So the way I would kind of phrase it is that when people ask me macro questions - will this dramatically extend dollar dominance? - my view is generally no. It's not a non-variable, but it's not as though it structurally changes my thesis around it. It's just like one variable among many that there's now certain new avenues to own dollars and therefore T-bill exposure in a way that wasn't before. So it's not zero, but it's not something I kind of reorient my world around.

Now if I put like my venture cap hat on - we do Bitcoin-related venture, some of those, especially in the developing world, will also have stablecoin usage in their products and services that they're building. And so I think there are multiple billion-dollar opportunities out there for companies to make use of stablecoins. I think the remittance market is still silly in terms of the prices and the frictions involved and the speed and the opaqueness of that. I think that can be resolved.

I don't think the US, even though we're the place of dollars, I don't think we're the key market for stablecoins. I think the rest of the world is, or certain parts of the world. And I think that it's just part of the ongoing digitization of money.

**Danny:** So when you think of like some of the potential use cases of stablecoins, I think thinking of them just as a dollar equivalent is maybe not quite the full picture in the sense that instead of just being a physical dollar, you're actually getting a dollar bank account. So if you're in a country like Egypt and you want to save dollars, instead of putting $20 bills under the mattress, you actually can have almost like a US dollar bank account.

And then the second point to that is: do you not see this as kind of a de facto dollarization for any of these countries? Like if you're in Egypt, why would you hold any Egyptian pounds if you could hold the dollar? Do you not think that could be the kind of bull case for stablecoins?

**Andy:** Well, I think the - well, let me explain what I think is so - all those things are maybe true. It's the issue is that it requires certain things that people don't understand, I think, regarding the physical plumbing of how dollars circulate through the world.

So there are two types of dollars basically. There's coinage and bills, physical currency, and there's electronic dollars. And as you said, currency and bills are in mattresses, in wallets, in vaults, wherever they are. That's where they are. And there's 1.2 trillion of them floating around outside of the United States. So that's one thing.

And then there's all this electronic dollars. And electronic dollars take really only two forms: bank deposits or securities. And bank deposit and money markets are really just a pass-through vehicle. You say, "Well, I have my money, my cash in a money market." No, you don't. The cash in the money market holds repo and treasury bills. It doesn't hold physical dollars. It holds repo and treasury bills.

So when somebody wants a dollar, they can only get one in two ways. They can convince somebody else that - well, there's only one way they can do it. They can convince somebody else to sell it to them. And so you have to ask yourself: okay, this Egyptian wants a dollar in his stablecoin wallet. He's going to have to get a dollar to deposit with the minter. Where's he going to get that dollar from? And he might get a physical dollar, physical dollar bill, and that'll get brought into the system. Or he might get somebody to sell their T-bill or monetize their money market fund. Only in that way - or he might get a bank to create money out of thin air by lending it to him. That's the only way money can move.

And all of them fund what Lyn was saying regarding the 1.6 to 3.7 trillion of new demand, which by the way, my own projection is 750 billion, of which is a tripling of existing stablecoin market. So it's going to happen, but the question is where does it come from, and does that create - and this is only macro - does that growth create new demand for dollars? It doesn't. It doesn't at all. It's just a transfer from people who have dollars to people who want dollars. And currently it - and it'll be made a little easier. The only place that new demand for bills comes from - likely demand is from people taking physical benjamins and converting them into stablecoins. That $1.2 trillion and $2.4 trillion globally is the TAM.

**Danny:** I may be misunderstanding here a little bit because like let's say you are in Egypt and you have Egyptian pounds. I assume you don't need dollars to buy a stablecoin. Like you could take your Egyptian pounds onto an exchange and get a stablecoin on an exchange.

**Andy:** No, no, you can't. Let me explain why. Of course you can. If there's somebody who's willing in the secondary market, you can get anything you want. But that's not new demand because somebody sold you that stablecoin for your Egyptian pounds. That's not new demand. But you cannot get a newly minted stablecoin created without physical - without US dollars.

**Lyn:** This is where I think that nuance really comes into play. So I don't disagree with anything Andy said except for part of the conclusion. So what stablecoins do is they increase the surface area of where these FX - these secondary market FX trades can even happen. So there are certain markets that are - that either dollars have trouble getting into or they're very expensive and shady to get.

By making them easier to get, there's more surface area where someone could say, "I have Egyptian pounds or Indian rupees or Argentine pesos," and I go to secondary market in some capacity - digital, physical, whatever - and I buy stablecoins with them. And some entrepreneur on the street or in the digital world is facilitating that liquidity, that connection. So that increases the surface area of people that could demand dollars and want dollars.

Now, they don't sit there and take a dollar and put it into the stablecoin. They bid whatever other currency they have for the stablecoin proxy of a dollar. And then what that does is that's around the margins a new bid for dollars that didn't exist before. Partly that takes away from the gray market premium that already exists. But if that gray market premium gets small enough and the whole process gets easier, more people might want dollars. Kind of like how the internet existed before the browser. The browser made it easier to use. Therefore, the demand for the internet increased, and therefore there was more people that wanted it.

So kind of like how stablecoins can make dollars easier to get. First, they can collapse the gray market demand or gray market premium. Then it potentially can increase the total demand for dollars because now it's an easier process. And then the mechanism is then stablecoins can trade at a slight premium to a dollar, which is where other players come in and they will do the process of giving the stablecoin issuer dollars and get stablecoins back, and that's how that arbitrage is done. That's how the peg is maintained.

And so it's not necessarily that the demand for the number of dollars increases per se, but the attractiveness of the dollar to pierce into these other markets and take market share from them potentially goes up in a way that I think is non-trivial. And therefore it does have some implications for dollar strength. It's not the only variable, but I think it's a new variable to consider that it can take market share from some existing developing market currencies more easily than it could in a purely physical form.

**Andy:** Right? I don't listen, I don't disagree that it is that there are a variety of potential places that stablecoin disintermediates. Number one is physical dollars, bills, literal bills. Number two is for foreign currencies that are really not desired. Now, if they were really not desired, there's already a great incentive for people to get out of them with friction. With friction is the point, right? But with friction agreed, and that friction will be released. So maybe some of that marginal dollar demand will agree. I don't disagree with you, Lyn.

And then the third one is bank deposits. And bank deposits are vulnerable because people may want to save for whatever term, but that comes at the expense of demand for assets. It's not free. So either it hurts the currency - the supply comes from either the physical dollars or the bank deposits or possibly some foreign currency related problems, which presumably those foreign countries are not going to be happy about and I agree they won't be and may act in some way. I don't know how they act, but they may act.

**Danny:** I think there's maybe another piece of this which is like you started this, Andy, by saying you wanted to talk about the stablecoins that are regulated under the GENIUS Act. I don't think it's out of the question to think maybe a Tether International type company spins off and does stablecoins that are purely based outside of the US, still backs them with a dollar, and does offer like a share of the yield that they're making on those treasuries. Like does that change the equation if we see something like that?

**Andy:** Well, I think the issue there is leverage. So if people want to take on a levered "trust me" exposure for a stablecoin that allows money - essentially money to be created, which has risk. So I don't really think of it, but there's I guess there's a potential for growth of non-backed interest-bearing stablecoins. But I wonder what the market - how the market isn't currently being served by the existing stablecoins. But maybe - but again, this is outside my expertise - that the international ones can still exist to be fully backed. It's just that their source of dollar exposure is either foreign dollar bank accounts or foreign holdings of T-bills that don't touch the US system. And so the downside of them is that if you're opting in the United States, you probably can't get a recipient to sell you like send you that international stablecoin right to your bank account in a future world where your bank account can even accept GENIUS Act stablecoins.

**Danny:** I see. So you're saying it's a - so again outside - it's a euro dollar, but you're saying it's a euro dollar, it's digital euro dollar.

**Andy:** I believe that there is - the again that's sourcing stablecoin demand, converting euro dollar existing supply into stablecoin existing supply. It doesn't change much net. It just gives, as you say, more access, which I think still hits the physical dollar market more than it does and potentially causes banks to struggle because they lose the deposits, right? These things have to fund some - the these deposits have a purpose right now. And whenever a disruptive technology like this causes bank deposits to shrink, that will have a tightening impact and less demand for dollars offset by this easier access to dollars that creates more demand. It's a tricky plumbing issue.

But I think you're right to think, as I said earlier, it's this disintermediation and temporary - you used one year, I was using shorter term - savings is definitely a demand for dollars. But absent that benjamins getting burned and this factor, I don't see anything that's going to save the US if they need to issue a ton of bills.

**Lyn:** I agree with you there. I don't think it's going to quote "save the US." I think it's a marginal new variable to consider in macro analysis for the dollar. I don't think it's the new biggest variable, but I think it's a new variable. There's open debate around the size of that variable. And any sort of headline number you see around stablecoin demand, the thing we would agree on is that not all of that and not even most of that is entirely new fresh demand for dollars and T-bills from foreign currency.

**Andy:** Right? I think the most of it - and I think the most that is, whatever that is and whatever the right number is, most of that excess demand which is new demand is going to come from physical currency.

**Lyn:** That's the part I'm not sure about because I think that there - some of that will come from physical currency, but then the question is how much entirely new demand for dollars will be generated if it's easier to do and the spreads are narrower.

**Andy:** I'm just saying where does it come from? I'm not saying it comes from - it comes from people that have - say you're right and somebody now because it's easier wants more dollars. How do they get them? They bid Egyptian pounds for stablecoins. They get the stablecoins. They bring the stablecoin peg to say a dollar and a cent. So $1.01 dollars. And then therefore someone else with access to dollars sends them to that stablecoin issuer. And where do they get them? They get them from the US financial system, which comes from where? Existing dollars. But the point is - okay, we agree. But it increases the total demand for dollars, which therefore does affect the exchange rate potentially of the dollar exchange rate.

**Lyn:** Yeah. I believe 100% that the biggest vulnerability to stablecoin demand from the rest of the world is on the depreciating force on those currencies.

**Danny:** Can I just see if I'm understanding this, Lyn? Are you saying that it creates new demand for dollars because someone is essentially paying a dollar and a cent for a dollar essentially?

**Lyn:** Yeah. I mean basically, so it's a little more - a couple more steps in that one is around the world there are people that have local currencies and there's a market often in their countries to get dollars, often physical dollars, and they're willing to sometimes pay a premium just because of the frictions of actually getting a dollar.

Now stablecoins can come in and say instead of literally going to a street corner in the shady part of town and making a physical trade with a duffel bag, you can do it on your phone or things like that. That can reduce the gray market premium. Therefore increase the overall interest in people in doing this. They might have said, "Look, I would like to get dollars, but I don't want to go through the hassle of that, so I'm just not going to. But if I can do it on my phone or easier at a cafe on a phone or something, whatever the case may be, then I'll do it."

So let's say there's new demand for dollars for similar reasons that there already demand, but it's just easier to do now. There's more demand. And the way it works is they go to a secondary seller, someone who's entrepreneurial in these markets and is acting as the facilitator, and they'll say, "Well, I'll give you this many Egyptian pounds or this many Argentine pesos for a stablecoin."

And to the extent that stablecoins therefore temporarily trade at a slight premium, there then the actual like entities that have an agreement with the issuer to give them - wire them or otherwise give them money and get stablecoins will do that because now there's an arbitrage to do that.

**Andy:** And you have first you have to convert the currency. Well, the ones that are doing that already have dollars is my point.

**Lyn:** So someone else in a market is trading their fiat currency for a stablecoin. Okay. And that's FX markets that are happening around the world.

**Andy:** From whom are they getting the - secondary seller? And what does the secondary seller have now? He now has their local currency. Okay. And has given them the stablecoin. Okay. Fine. Now what?

**Lyn:** Now that stablecoin trades at a slight premium, assuming this is happening at scale, compared to some starting baseline. Yep. And therefore someone who has the ability and an agreement with the stablecoin issuer to mint stablecoins will say, "Okay, I'll send you a million dollars." Well, sorry. Let me come back before we do that. I forgot to deal with the important issue. The person who had the stablecoin before that now has Egyptian pesos, Egyptian currency. They don't want that and they have de-dollarized.

**Andy:** Sure. But they repeat it. I'm wondering whether that's where's the net demand that you're talking about?

**Lyn:** Well, so the net demand is from the end user. The middleman - they will, for example, buy stable coins or dollars at 48 per Egyptian pounds and then they'll sell it at 51 per Egyptian pound. That's a great market premium.

**Andy:** Right? Just walk me through the flow because this is where I really want to understand. Secondary market transaction. Guy buys a stablecoin, guy sells a stablecoin in local currency. Where's the dollar demand?

**Lyn:** The dollar demand is from the end user. Let's say -

**Andy:** No, no. I'm just talking about that transaction. Well, but the transaction involves the end user. So someone -

**Andy:** No, it's just those two - there are two parties that are involved.

**Lyn:** Yeah. The person who's trading the fiat currency for the stablecoin is where the demand is.

**Andy:** And doesn't it net, assuming that it just happens once, but then the broker then says, "Okay, well, there's clearly a demand for what I'm doing. I will go and get more stablecoins." Okay, so they pass on the demand to somebody else. They have to do first they - so initial buyer comes with Egyptian pound, gives it to - gets a stablecoin from a seller of a stablecoin who now has Egyptian pounds. Yes. So far, I haven't seen any net demand for US dollars. All I've seen that the fact that it was a stablecoin is irrelevant. It could have been chicken.

**Lyn:** Let's start with paper dollars and then move to stablecoins. So right now, physical dollars get into Egypt in some way. People literally bring them on a plane in suitcases. Yeah. Now, if there was no demand for dollars in Egypt, nobody would bother doing that. But there is demand for dollars in Egypt, and there's a certain premium even people are willing to pay to get dollars because it's not trivial to do so.

And so someone comes in with a duffel bag of $10,000, let's say, whatever the legal limit is or sometimes illegal, whatever. They come in with a duffel bag. They then make a market of being a - being say, "I will give you, if you want dollars and the official exchange rate is, let's say, 50, I'll give them to you for 52." Yep.

Should you want to give your dollars back because maybe an Egyptian is holding dollars for a six-month period to save up for a car, right? Maybe they now - they finally want to buy the car. They actually want to sell their dollars back to the market. The same broker or a friend of the broker might say, "Okay, I'll buy them from you for 48 Egyptian pounds."

So there's a market for that person making a spread. Now if let's say currently there's a billion dollar stock of physical US currency in Egypt - that's arbitrary number - now if next year because of some policy or whatever that there's now 1.2 billion in demand, and there's a shortage, they start bidding up that gray market premium because it's harder to find people to say, "Yes, I will make this trade."

So then someone will fly another duffel bag over there. They'll find a way to get dollars in the US or elsewhere, right? Fly it into Egypt. And therefore more dollars are in there.

**Andy:** There's scarce flying it back. Where does that come from? Where does that come from? From the treasury and issued through the banking system.

**Lyn:** And so okay, so the dollars in this case - their state, their financial system dollars. We can keep using the currency. So a physical bag of dollars goes out. Where did that dollar come from?

**Andy:** Those dollars came from the Treasury and the US banking system. Right. And so they were supporting existing banking. Yes. Right. Yeah. And so if you do that enough, you start to get a shortage in the US of physical currency. And there is a degree of fungibility between bank reserves and currency. A bank can do it. A person can't. But if enough people go to the bank and say, "I want currency," and the bank keeps finding themselves not enough currency, then they go to their Fed and say, "We need to make this trade." So then there's more demand for currency. It gets out there, and then some of it finds its way into duffel bags around the world. And that's exactly the way.

So what I think is happening with physical dollars in Egypt, physical bills, is you're going to see the duffel bags going in the other direction. And what you're going to see coming in this direction is stablecoins.

**Lyn:** So partially, but here I think the additional part of that is let's say currently there's a billion dollar stock of dollars in Egypt, and if you say, "Okay, we made the process way easier because it's digital," I think there are some - there are nonzero number of Egyptians that say, "I didn't bother to get dollars before even though I would have liked them. I just didn't bother. Now I will." And so now there's 1.5 billion in active demand for dollars in Egypt, and stable coins can fill that gap because that - we agree, and I think where it happens is it - and that whole process just is a currency market event.

**Andy:** Yeah, it's a currency market. Now, but the final thing is where it can actually somewhat affect the supply is the Fed and to some extent the Treasury, when they're determining policies, either fiscal, monetary policies that either expand or contract the money supply. They're partially looking at inflation when they do this, at least especially the Fed.

If around the margins, the stronger the dollar is, the more leeway they have to enact policies that are growth - growth of credit, either base money or broad money or both. And so to the extent around the margins that the dollar is strong, it can actually increase the number of dollars that are out there because the entities that are capable of doing that are more likely to allow that to happen.

There might be less demand among voters for the Congress to reduce fiscal deficits if the dollar is strong enough that there might be less - the Fed is more conducive to doing things that either QE or lower rates to encourage banks to lend more, whatever the case may be.

**Andy:** Right, so I agree. So you're - I think I'm reaching the point where I see the foreign demand creating currency pressures, debanking pressures, and possibly that leading to easier monetary policy and thus more dollars. Yes. Yes, I see. Yeah, that makes sense to me.

**Lyn:** Yeah. And then the question is what's the magnitude? That's the question, right? And the magnitude to me depends on back to the beginning, which is you've got 1.2 and two trillion of bills. I mean, currency in circulation. I think that's a real TAM. I think we're going to see a lot of that turn into stablecoins. You've got the ease demand, which we kicked around some numbers. Like, how many people have savings that they can't save in dollars right now? And we know there are billions of people. So is it a billion people have $1,000 of savings they want to do? Or is it 100 million people that have $10,000 savings? It's not three billion with $1,000 around that they want to convert into dollars. So it ain't three trillion, but it's probably something more than a couple of hundred billion.

**Andy:** I think when you add small businesses, I think you can add another trillion.

**Lyn:** You think they're going to want to - small businesses are really good at sweeping things to things that pay interest.

**Andy:** Well, again, in let's say Africa, small businesses throughout Africa, small businesses throughout Latin America, small businesses throughout - no, but I think that collectively there - like there's a - like in the US the value of small businesses collectively is big, and that's generally true for other places as well. And so I think the combination of consumer demand and small business demand, not just for dollars but for basically a dollar bank account effectively cross -

**Andy:** I think that's interesting. I think I haven't done the numbers. I'd be interested in the numbers, and I'd be irresponsible to just sort of rough it out. But we are a significant portion of the global economy. The global economy is a collection of big and small businesses. It seems large to be anywhere in the trillions with this type of excess demand. I think we could hit a trillion.

**Lyn:** Yeah. Okay. I'm at 750. We'll see what the market looks like then.

**Danny:** But yeah, I'm mindful of time. Well, yeah, I think that the key takeaway here, Andy, is that you're bearish treasury companies, you're neutral stablecoins. I think the hardcore Bitcoiners are going to love you.

**Andy:** I doubt it. But I really doubt it. I really doubt it.

**Danny:** Well, you were relatively bullish Bitcoin. So there you go. But thank you guys so much for the time. I really appreciate it. Andy, where do you want to send anyone that wants to check out your work?

**Andy:** Dampspring.com or I'm dampspring on Twitter. And I really appreciate it from both of you. This was a pleasure and I really appreciate the debate. Enjoy the conversation. It's been a lot of fun.

**Danny:** Lyn, you close out. Where can people follow you? I mean, I assume everyone already follows you, but shout it anyway.

**Lyn:** People can check out lynalden.com or my book "Broken Money." And I appreciate the conversation, both you for hosting it, and Andy for bringing up all these interesting points.

**Danny:** Perfect. That was a lot of fun. Thank you, guys.
