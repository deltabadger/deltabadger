# Defining Digital Assets

## DACS: The Digital Asset Classification Standard

As the broad spectrum of digital assets grows, how does one categorize this sprawling and ever evolving landscape? The answer is simple. The Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), created by CoinDesk Indices.

## How is DACS designed?

*   Seeks to classify the top 250 digital assets by market capitalization¹
*   Classification is determined by use case and technology of the digital asset categorized into a three-tiered hierarchy of Sectors, Industry Groups, and Industries
*   Each digital asset is assigned to an industry, and each industry is assigned to an industry group and finally, each industry group is placed within one of seven distinct sectors: currency, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi), culture & entertainment, computing, stablecoin, and digitization

## How will DACS evolve in this ever-changing landscape?

*   Market feedback is gathered through consultations with CoinDesk Indices and a DACS Advisory Council
*   Assets are reconstituted on a monthly basis to ensure largest assets are captured and classified
*   Material changes are announced prior to implementation

## Does CoinDesk Indices offer indices covering DACS?

*   The CoinDesk 20 Index is the reference index to measure, trade and invest in the crypto asset class. Designed with liquidity, diversification benefits, and implementation in mind, the CoinDesk 20 Index is built for trading.
*   CoinDesk Crypto Sectors is a suite of thoughtfully designed investable sector indices for the ever-changing global crypto landscape.
*   The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family delivers a suite of non-investible indices that function as a benchmark for the performance of the digital asset market.
