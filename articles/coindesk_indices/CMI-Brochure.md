# The CoinDesk Market Index Family

## Defining and Measuring the Digital Asset Market

The **CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family** delivers a suite of indices that function as a benchmark for the performance of the digital asset market. This framework has spawned the investible **CoinDesk 20 Index** and **Crypto Sector Suite**, designed to provide institutional quality intelligence and building blocks for investment products.

## A rigorous framework

> **Why hasn’t a trusted index arisen for crypto until now?** Because the digital asset landscape is highly dynamic and ever-changing. Identifying the different sectors and categorizing assets requires thorough analysis and rules that are consistently applied. Moreover, market data remains unreliable. There are inconsistencies across the many exchanges around the world that list the same assets but under very different regulatory and operational frameworks.

To meet this market need, CoinDesk Indices launched the groundbreaking **Digital Assets Classification Standard (DACS)**. DACS seeks to classify the top 250 digital assets by market capitalization¹ and assign each asset to an industry defined by its technology and use case. Each digital asset is assigned to an industry, and each industry is assigned to an industry group and finally, each industry group is placed within one of six distinct sectors: currency, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi), culture & entertainment, computing, and digitization.

This consistently applied framework functions as the foundation for the CMI family of market benchmarks.

## Benchmarking digital assets

- **Broad-based benchmarks:** the CMI broad market indices can be a proxy for the entire crypto asset class. As the new digital asset class emerges, market participants and observers will need a new reference index to measure performance, invest, and trade. Drawn from the CMI universe, the CoinDesk 20 Index was created to fulfill this market need. Designed with liquidity, diversification benefits, and implementation in mind, the CoinDesk 20 is the reference for the crypto asset class.
- **Sector-based benchmarks:** the CMI sector subindices seek to help quantify contributions to returns and risk by sectors, and measure sector exposures of managers versus their benchmarks and peer groups. Moreover, the sector subindices seek to measure performance of sector focused funds that can be used to build sector rotation strategies. For crypto native builders and investors, the CMI family provides general and sector peer groups and benchmarks of competitors for comparison and valuation. Drawn from the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) universe, CoinDesk Crypto Sectors is a suite of thoughtfully designed investable sector indices for the ever-changing global crypto landscape.

## Index Construction

For an asset to be included in the CMI family, there are four overarching criteria. The asset must be:

1.  Part of the CoinDesk DACS
2.  Listed on at least two eligible exchanges
3.  Listed on an eligible exchange for a minimum of 30 days
4.  Available by a CoinDesk reference rate

The constituents that meet these four requirements are then weighted by market capitalization, reconstituted and rebalanced on a monthly basis.
