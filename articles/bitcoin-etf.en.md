For the first decade of Bitcoin existence, ETFs were mythical ghosts on the horizon that will move price of Bitcoin "to the moon." In February 2021, the first ETF was finally accepted in Canada (BTCC), and seven months later ProShares launched BITO in the US. Rewinding forward, just 18 months since the approval 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs account for $150B+ AUM, with BlackRock IBIT alone hitting $80B, but the landscape is much bigger.

In fact, there are so many of them that regular investor can be confused:

* Which one should you choose?
* Why even choose it over just buying Bitcoin?
* What's the difference between spot and future ETFs?
* Which one is available in Europe?

Let's dive in.

## Why ETF?

For institutional investors choosing exposure to Bitcoin via ETF is often just necessity since they cannot hold cryptocurrencies directly, but are there any reasons why an individual investor should consider them?

There are two main reasons:

### Easy Portfolio Management
You can buy Bitcoin ETFs in your regular brokerage account alongside stocks. No need to deal with crypto exchanges, wallets, or complicated rebalancing between different platforms.

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Most retirement and pension accounts (like 401(k) in the US, ISAs in the UK, or PEAs in France) can't hold actual Bitcoin directly. But they can hold Bitcoin ETFs. This lets you get Bitcoin exposure while keeping the tax benefits of these special accounts.

## Spot, Futures, ETP…?

When you start looking at available options, the first thing to understand are differences between three main types of Bitcoin investment products, because they work very differently:

**Spot ETF** buys and holds actual Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes up $1, your ETF goes up roughly $1. Spot ETFs are usually best for most people - they're simple and track Bitcoin closely.

**Futures ETF** buys a contract to own Bitcoin in the future, not actual Bitcoin. It can lose money even when Bitcoin goes up due to "rolling" cost. Available in the US since 2021. Example: BITO (ProShares), BTF (Valkyrie).

**ETP (Exchange Traded Product)** works like spot ETF but is more common in Europe. It buys and holds actual Bitcoin. Similar tracking to spot ETF. Example: WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin, iShares Bitcoin ETP.

**ETC (Exchange Traded Commodity)**, but in the cryptocurrency world, it's often rebranded as Exchange Traded Crypto. In practice, there's no difference between ETC and ETP for an investor.

**ETN (Exchange Traded Note)** is basically an IOU from a bank promising to pay you Bitcoin's performance. If the bank fails, you lose everything. **There's really no good reason for an individual investor to choose ETN.**

### Tax Benefits
If you trade Bitcoin a lot in the US, futures ETFs like BITO give you better tax rates. You pay lower taxes on 60% of your gains, even if you only held the ETF for a short time.

### Income Generation
Some Bitcoin ETFs can make extra money when Bitcoin futures cost more than regular Bitcoin prices. The ETF also earns interest on the cash it holds.

## Products

### Spot Bitcoin ETFs

As of September 2025, there are 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the US, which directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. These were primarily approved by the SEC in early 2024, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) launched later that year to offer a lower-fee alternative to the original Grayscale fund. Below is a complete list, sorted by expense ratio (lowest to highest).

### Futures-Based and Strategy Bitcoin ETFs

In addition to spot ETFs, there are several futures-based or indirect Bitcoin exposure ETFs, which do not hold Bitcoin directly but invest in Bitcoin futures contracts, mining stocks, or blockchain-related assets. These provide alternative exposure but may underperform spot ETFs due to futures roll costs. Here are the key ones as of September 2025.

### What about Europe?

Although traditional spot Bitcoin ETFs are not permitted in Europe due to strict UCITS regulations, there are a variety of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) and Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) that function similarly by providing direct or synthetic exposure to Bitcoin's price. These products are actively traded on major European stock exchanges, including the SIX Swiss Exchange (Switzerland), Xetra and Börse Frankfurt (Germany), and others.

## How to pick the best Bitcoin ETF?

Which Bitcoin ETF is best for you? Here are our top picks for US and European investors:

### US

When choosing a Bitcoin ETF in the US, focus on low fees (under 0.25%), high liquidity (measured by trading volume and assets), and trusted issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity. All US spot ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, so avoid futures-based ones like BITO that can lag due to extra costs.

[**BTC**](https://etfs.grayscale.com/btc) (Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust) — Lowest ongoing fee at 0.15%, making it best for long-term holders focused on minimizing costs. Smaller than the others but still solid with $10B+ assets.

[**IBIT**](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) (iShares Bitcoin Trust) — The biggest and most liquid option with $86B in assets. BlackRock's reputation makes it ideal for large investors who want easy trading. Fee is 0.25% but temporarily reduced to 0.12% until January 2025.

[**FBTC**](https://institutional.fidelity.com/advisors/investment-solutions/asset-classes/alternatives/fidelity-wise-origin-bitcoin-fund) (Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund) — Great balance of cost and reliability with $50B+ assets. Perfect if you already use Fidelity for other investments. Same 0.25% fee as IBIT.

### Europe

European options are smaller overall but work similarly to US spot ETFs. Look for physically backed ETPs with low fees (under 0.25%) and good exchange listings like Xetra or SIX. Note that some products are only available to professional investors, though retail access is expanding.

[**WBIT**](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=GB00BJYDH287) (WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin) — Low 0.15% fee with $1B+ assets and strong track record. Good choice for cost-conscious long-term investors.

[**IB1T**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/professional/en/products/337088/) (iShares Bitcoin ETP) — BlackRock's European product with promotional 0.15% fee until December 2025, then 0.25%. Best for those wanting premium brand security.

[**BTCE**](https://bitwiseinvestments.eu/products/bitwise-physical-bitcoin-etp/) (Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP) — Highest European liquidity with $1.3B assets and 5-year track record. Great for active traders who want flexibility, though fee is slightly higher at 0.20%.

## Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs

Michael Saylor says "there is no second best," but we all know that Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency institutional investors are very interested in. Not only do we have a similar family of Ethereum ETFs available, but there are also the first products tracking both:

### US

When choosing a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in the US, prioritize low fees (around 0.95%) and liquidity, though options are limited to futures-based strategies since no spot ETFs track both BTC and ETH. These can lag spot prices due to roll costs, so they're best for short-term tactical plays rather than long holds.

[**BTF**](https://coinshares.com/us/etf/btf/) (Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF) — The only actively managed option (currently close to market cap weighting). Exposure to BTC and ETH is achieved through futures, with a 0.95% fee.

[**BETH**](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/beth) (ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF) — Tracks a market-cap weighted basket of BTC and ETH futures for balanced exposure. Great for passive investors; fee waived to 0% until Sep 30, 2025 (then 0.95%).

[**BETE**](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/bete) (ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF) — Equal-weight approach to BTC and ETH futures gives more exposure to ETH, but also potentially more "volatility harvesting" with rebalancing. Smaller at ~$10M+ assets but useful for even-split strategies; same 0.95% fee (waived until Sep 30, 2025).

### Europe

European combined BTC and ETH options are scarce and mostly physically backed ETPs for direct exposure. Focus on low TER (under 0.50%), physical backing, and listings on exchanges like SIX Swiss. Retail access is growing but check local rules.

[**ABBA**](https://www.21shares.com/en-eu/product/abba) (21Shares Bitcoin Ethereum Core ETP) — The go-to for pure BTC and ETH exposure, physically backed with monthly reweighting by market cap. Compact at €34M but reliable for long-term holds; TER is 0.49%.

[**MEGA**](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=GB00BMTP1733) (WisdomTree Physical Crypto Mega Cap Equal Weight ETP) — Strictly equal weight (aims for 50/50 BTC/ETH, rebalanced quarterly; as of early September 2025, it's ~50.2% ETH and 49.8% BTC due to minor market fluctuations). TER 0.95%.

## Replicate!

As you can see, weighted funds have higher expense ratios getting close to 1%, which long-term is really a bummer. But why not [replicate it with Deltabadger with zero fees](/)?

The rebalancing bot allows you to mimic both market cap weighting like BETH/ABBA and manually set ratios like BTF/BETE/MEGA.

![Rebalanced DCA](https://deltabadger.com/images/articles/mcap/rebalanced-dca.avif)

Rebalanced DCA delivers indexing with only "buy" orders, meaning in moments of high volatility, or when you stop contributing, it will perform slightly differently than the equivalent ETF. Long-term, our vision is to bring traditional rebalancing to Deltabadger as well. The benefit of the current approach is **the lack of tax events**.

## Conclusion

While ETFs offer a tempting and convenient way to get "Bitcoin exposure," it's worth remembering that Bitcoin represents more than just an investment vehicle.

Jeff Park's [Radical Portfolio Theory](./radical-portfolio-theory) highlights the systemic risk inherent in all "compliant" assets. True diversification should consider not only portfolio volatility but also the risk of losing access to your assets. Storing your entire wealth in one brokerage account carries substantial risk.

However, if you [keep a significant portion of your Bitcoin safely on a hardware wallet](https://deltabadger.com/blog/coldcard-vs-trezor-vs-jade-vs-bitbox-bitcoin-only-wallet/), adding an ETF to your portfolio can provide useful flexibility for rebalancing and tax advantages through retirement accounts.
