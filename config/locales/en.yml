        <p class="mt-1">Our referral program <b>pays up to $50</b><sup>1</sup> per user in BTC (using an exchange ratio from the transaction). Example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>For simplicity, the price of Bitcoin is ~$10000, the discount is 10%, and your margin is 20%.</li>
          <li>Referee buys a 1-year plan for $49.99, paying after the discount $44.99 what equals 0.0045BTC. You earn 0.001BTC (20% of $49.99).</li>
          <li>It doesn't matter if the price of Bitcoin changes in the meantime. Your profit is locked in BTC.</li>
          <li>Next time, the referee buys a 4-year plan for $149.99 and pays 0.015BTC. He or she doesn't get a discount anymore, but you still get your 20% what equals 0.003BTC.</li>
          <li>You continue to profit as long as you have an active plan<sup>2</sup>, and your total profit per referee does not reach $50.</li>
