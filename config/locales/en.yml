          The magic of
          <span class="no-break">dollar-cost</span>
          <br>
          averaging in
          <span class="no-break">4 easy charts</span
        easy1:
          title_html: Wait… what is DCA?
          text_html: |
            <p>DCA is a strategy of investing where you buy an asset for a fixed amount on a regular schedule regardless of its price. You get more of the asset when the price is lower, and less of it when the price is higher. As a result, instead of taking big short-term bets, you get a fair average price.</p>
            <p>DCA keeps you away from the emotional rollercoaster, short-term risk, and decision making anxiety.</p>
          chart_regular_purchases: Regular purchases
          chart_average_price: Average price
        easy2:
          title_html: Should I wait for correction <span class="no-break">to start?</span>
          text_html: |
            <p>No. For an appreciating asset, it's always better to start earlier, even at the top! Eventually, the price will go higher, and whoever started earlier ends up with lower average price.</p>
          chart_earlier: Earlier
          chart_better_average_price: better average price
        easy3:
          title_html: Why is it better than a <span class="no-break">lump sum investment</span>?
          text_html: |
            <p>In the short-term, the price may still go up, down or sideways. Lump sum wins only in the first scenario. DCA wins in two others. The magic of DCA puts you in green even if the price didn't change at the end.</p>
          chart_lump_sum: Lump sum = 5 units
          chart_dca: DCA = 6 units
        easy4:
          title_html: Can I improve DCA with RSI <span class="no-break">or Mayer Multiple</span>?
          text_html: |
            <p>Not really. Oscillators don't work well in an upward trend. The next bottom is often higher than the previous top. There is no automated strategy that wins with DCA, because DCA is simply investing in the market trend which can't be beaten consistently with any math formula.</p>
          chart_price: Price
          chart_mm: Mayer Multiple
