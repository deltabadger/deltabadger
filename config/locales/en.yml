                    <p>We call it <i>averaging</i>, but trust me, there's nothing average about what you're doing.</p>

                    <p>But watch out—if your tax reporting software charges per transaction, that's a good reason to buy less often.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, keep transactions small and frequent, and let the magic of DCA kick in sooner.</p>

            intro: "Evaluate my portfolio in the style of Naval tweets. Find geopolitical or technical thesis behind, and relevant macro events in the recent years. Notice if portfolio reminds you of some investing style or popular idea like 3-fund portfolio, etc. Point out overlapping assets like ETFs with the same stocks (only if there are any). Then show up to 5 pros and/or cons organized so all pros go first. Put more attention to metrics like volatility and beta, then those mostly reflecting past like Sharpe. Use Poor/Neutral/Good/Exceptional scale."
