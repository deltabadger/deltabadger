          The magic of
          <span class="no-break">dollar-cost</span>
          <br>
          averaging in
          <span class="no-break">4 easy charts</span
        easy1:
          title_html: Wait… what is DCA?
          text_html: |
            <p>DCA is a strategy of investing where you buy an asset for a fixed amount on a regular schedule regardless of its price. You get more of the asset when the price is lower, and less of it when the price is higher. As a result, instead of taking big short-term bets, you get a fair average price. DCA keeps you away from the emotional rollercoaster, short-term risk, and decision making anxiety.</p>
          chart_regular_purchases: Regular purchases
          chart_average_price: Average price
        easy2:
          title_html: Should I wait for correction <span class="no-break">to start?</span>
          text_html: |
            <p>No. For an appreciating asset, it's always better to start earlier, even at the top! Eventually, the price will go higher, and whoever started earlier ends up with lower average price.</p>
          chart_earlier: Earlier
          chart_better_average_price: better average price
        easy3:
          title_html: Why is it better than a <span class="no-break">lump sum investment</span>?
          text_html: |
            <p>In the short-term, the price may still go up, down or sideways. Lump sum wins only in the first scenario. DCA wins in two others. The magic of DCA puts you in green even if the price didn't change at the end.</p>
          chart_lump_sum: Lump sum = 5 units
          chart_dca: DCA = 6 units
        easy4:
          title_html: Can I improve DCA with RSI <span class="no-break">or Mayer Multiple</span>?
          text_html: |
            <p>Not really. Oscillators don't work well in an upward trend. The next bottom is often higher than the previous top. There is no automated strategy that wins with DCA, because DCA is simply investing in the market trend which can't be beaten consistently with any math formula.</p>
          chart_price: Price
          chart_mm: Mayer Multiple

      <p class="mt-1">Our referral program <b>pays up to $50</b><sup>1</sup> per user in BTC (using an exchange ratio from the transaction). Example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For simplicity, the price of Bitcoin is ~$10000, the discount is 10%, and your margin is 20%.</li>
        <li>Referee buys a 1-year plan for $49.99, paying after the discount $44.99 what equals 0.0045BTC. You earn 0.001BTC (20% of $49.99).</li>
        <li>It doesn't matter if the price of Bitcoin changes in the meantime. Your profit is locked in BTC.</li>
        <li>Next time, the referee buys a 4-year plan for $149.99 and pays 0.015BTC. He or she doesn't get a discount anymore, but you still get your 20% what equals 0.003BTC.</li>

          <p className="mt-2"><b>Exchanges</b></p>
          <p>Deltabadger works with cryptoexchanges. At the moment, we support <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=NUYVIP6R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Binance.US</a>, <a href="https://auth.bitbay.net/ref/Hhb7ZrAv2GrA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Bitbay">Bitbay</a>, <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coinbase Pro</a>, <a href="https://exchange.gemini.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://ftx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitso.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bitso</a> and <a href="https://r.kraken.com/deltabadger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Kraken">Kraken</a>. We recommend Kraken as a reputable exchange that has never been hacked. Use Bitbay if you want to make your purchases in PLN.</p>
          <p>To make your bot useful, first, you need to verify your exchange account and transfer some funds there.</p>
          <p>However, don't keep your coins at any exchange too long. Login to your account and do regularly withdraws at least once a month.</p>
          <p>We will add more exchanges in the future. Let us know if you are interested in a particular one.</p>
        smart_intervals_html: |
          <p className="mt-2"><b>"Smart intervals"</b></p>
          <p>When smart intervals are turned on, Deltabadger executes your desired schedule in the smallest transactions allowed by the exchange. Otherwise, they'll be used only if necessary.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><b>Why?</b></p>
          <p>There are two benefits:</p>
          <p>The more frequent schedule allows you to experience the benefits of DCA quicker and smooths it out even more.</p>
          <p>Also, sometimes smart intervals are necessary. Every exchange has a minimum transaction size limit. Some exchanges define it in BTC, so the USD value changes over time. If the amount you want to buy is smaller, Deltabadger keeps your desired ratio using the minimum allowed size but adjusting the time interval. It protects bot from being stopped when your defined amount falls below the threshold.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><b>Example:</b></p>
          <p>Let's say the current exchange limit is $20. If you set the transaction size for $24/day, the bot will do exactly that. However, if you define it as $1/hour, it will mimic the ratio using the allowed size, which equals $20 every 20 hours. On average, it results in the same ratio ($24/day = $1/hour = $20/20hours).</p>
