                <p><strong>BTC-ETH</strong> — "Digital gold" meets Web3. Cover 74% of the crypto market with a simple, no-hassle portfolio that rebalances on autopilot.</p>
                <p><strong>ETH-SOL</strong> — Which Web3 platform will win? Invest in both and let the market decide. Rebalancing ensures you end up on the winning side.</p>
                <p><strong>BTC-PAXG</strong> — Cross-asset diversification. Pax Gold is a unique stablecoin that is not correlated with crypto but still offers attractive upside.</p>
