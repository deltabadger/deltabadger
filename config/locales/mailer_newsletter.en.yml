            <h2>The community is back.</h2>

            <p>After a long search for the best platform, I realised that Skool works best.</p>
            <p>Now, it has a "Classroom" featuring our first <a href="https://www.skool.com/firestarters-1846">Altcoin Season playbook</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.skool.com/firestarters-1846">Join the community before we move it behind a paywall</a>.</p>
            <p>All active users who join before then will remain free forever.</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
            <p>Jan</p>
