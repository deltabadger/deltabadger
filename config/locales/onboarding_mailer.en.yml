                <p><i>I love to pay fees.</i><br>
                <small>*Said no one ever.</small></p>
                <p>Most investors accept exchange fees as "the cost of doing business."</p>
                <p>But here's the trick:</p>
                <p>When the exchange charges you a 0.25% fee, use FeeCutter to place limit orders 0.25% below the current price, and effectively cut fees to ZERO.</p>
                <p><b>Why this works:</b></p>
                <p>Crypto prices move constantly.<br>
                The 0.25% gap gets filled by natural market movement within a few hours 99% of the time.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b></p>
                <p>Coinbase charges a 0.6% fee (!).<br>
                If you invest $2000/month, you're bleeding <b>$144/year</b> in fees.</p>
                <p>This is how much you save with FeeCutter, enough to cover the cost of:</p>

                <p><i>The best time to buy was yesterday. The second best time? When RSI hits 30.</i></p>
                <p>Traders use thousands of indicators to catch the bottom.</p>
                <p>Smart traders use RSI.</p>
                <p>It's simple.</p>
                <p>RSI below 30 = sell-out = time to buy.</p>
                <p><b>Why it works:</b></p>
                <p>RSI measures momentum on a scale of 0-100. When it drops below 30, the asset is likely undervalued and due for a bounce.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b></p>
                <p>Every single time Bitcoin's RSI was below 30 on the weekly chart, it was a perfect opportunity to DCA and catch the bottom.</p>

                <p><i>One thing is better than avoiding taxes: doing it legally.</i></p>
                <p>Most investors rebalance their portfolio by selling best-performing assets.</p>
                <p>But every sale means a capital gains tax.</p>
                <p>Here's a better way:</p>
                <p>Rebalanced DCA using only BUY orders.</p>
                <p><b>How it works:</b></p>
                <p>Instead of selling your growing assets, the bot simply buys more of the falling ones during your regular DCA.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b></p>
                <p>Your 50/50 BTC-ETH portfolio drifts to 60/40 because Bitcoin exploded.</p>
                <p>Traditional rebalancing: sell some Bitcoin, and pay capital gains tax ❌</p>
                <p>Rebalanced DCA: buy more Ethereum, and pay no tax ✅</p>

                <p>Result: You maintain your target allocation without the tax office getting involved.</p>

                <p>Most Bitcoin predictions are just guessing, but Lyn Alden's research shows that:</p>
                <p><b>Bitcoin follows one pattern 83% of the time</b>.</p>
                <p>Yes, I'm talking about the M2 correlation.</p>
                <p>This isn't "crypto astrology":</p>
                <p>📈 When more money gets printed (M2 grows), Bitcoin tends to go up.</p>
                <p>📉 When money printing slows down or stops, Bitcoin tends to underperform.</p>
                <p>Applying it is hard?</p>
