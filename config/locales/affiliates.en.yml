              <ol>
                <li>Your friend buys a Pro plan for $299/year. You earn $60 in BTC (at the exchange rate of the transaction).</li>

                <li>If they upgrade to our Lifetime plan ($2,000+), you earn $400+ in BTC instantly.</li>
                <li>Your earnings are locked in BTC at the time of the transaction, protecting you from price fluctuations.</li>
                <li>Commissions are credited instantly and paid out monthly.</li>
