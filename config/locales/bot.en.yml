                    <h3>What is DCA?</h3>
                    <p>Imagine market as your piggy bank. Every day you drop in one coin—whether prices are up, down, or sideways.</p>
                    <p>We call it <i>averaging</i>, but trust me, there's nothing average about what you're doing.</p>
                    <p>The average investor? They hesitate, panic, sell too soon.</p>
                    <p>But not you.</p>
                    <p>You're chilling like Grandpa Warren sipping his Coke, letting the market do its thing.</p>

                    <h3>Smart Intervals</h3>
                    <p>Exchanges have minimum order sizes. Smart intervals handle this for you:</p>
                    <p>Want to buy $5 a day, but the minimum is $10? They'll place your $10 order every second day.</p>

                    <h3>Daily? Weekly? Monthly?</h3>
                    <p>Surprisingly, long-term results are so close it doesn't really matter.</p>
                    <p>But watch out—if your tax reporting software charges per transaction, that's a good reason to buy less often.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, keep transactions small and frequent, and let the magic of DCA kick in sooner.</p>
