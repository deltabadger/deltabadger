                <p><b>Market cap</b> is a way to measure how big or valuable a coin is. It's calculated by multiplying the total number of coins by the current price of one coin. In your bot, the coin with the bigger market cap gets a larger share of your investment.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b></p>
                <p><b>Coin A:</b> 2 millions coins exist, each worth $10. The market cap equals 2M × $10 = $20M.</p>
                <p><b>Coin B:</b> 1 million coins exist, each worth $1. Market cap = 1M × $1 = $1M.</p>
                <p>If you invest $100, the bot will split it proportionally to their market caps: $95.2 to Coin A, $4.8 to Coin B.</p>
                <p>But if Coin B's price rises to $3, its market cap becomes $3M. Now, the next $100 will allocate $87 to Coin A and $13 to Coin B.</p>

                    <p>Imagine market as your piggy bank. Every day you drop in one coin—whether prices are up, down, or sideways.</p>
                    <p>We call it <i>averaging</i>, but trust me, there's nothing average about what you're doing.</p>

                    <p>But watch out—if your tax reporting software charges per transaction, that's a good reason to buy less often.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, keep transactions small and frequent, and let the magic of DCA kick in sooner.</p>
