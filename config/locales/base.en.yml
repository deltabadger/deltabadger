Notice if portfolio reminds you of some investing style or popular idea like 3-fund portfolio, etc. Point out overlapping assets like ETFs with the same stocks (only if there are any). Then show up to 5 pros and/or cons organized so all pros go first. Put more attention to metrics like volatility and beta, then those mostly reflecting past like Sharpe. Use Poor/Neutral/Good/Exceptional scale."
